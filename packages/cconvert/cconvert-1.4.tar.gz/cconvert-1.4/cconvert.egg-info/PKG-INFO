Description: # Terminal-currency-converter
        
        This is a rest based service written with python that uses the existing https://api.ratesapi.io service to get the JSON output for all the currencies with respect to a base currency. Usually the base currency can be altered according to the users needs.
        
        A simple get call example can explain the working
        
        ```
        https://api.ratesapi.io/api/latest?base=USD
        ```
        The above example returns a JSON that contains the corresponding values of the present day currency with respect to the base currency provided in the URL.
