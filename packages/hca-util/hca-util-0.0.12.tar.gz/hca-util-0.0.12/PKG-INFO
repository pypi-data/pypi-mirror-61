        ## Prerequisites
        Users need to have
        1. Basic command-line knowledge
        2. Python3.x installed on their machine
        3. Credentials to access data in the S3 bucket (access and secret keys)
        
        ## Install and configure
        1. Get the tool from PyPi
        
                $ pip install hca-util
        
        2. Run the `hca-util` tool
        
                $ hca-util
                Type ? to list commands
                hca>
        
        3. Run `config` command specifying your credentials
        
                hca> config ACCESS_KEY SECRET_KEY
        
        Step 2 opens an interactive prompt.
        
        Step 3 adds a new *hca-util* profile to your local AWS configuration which the tool uses.
