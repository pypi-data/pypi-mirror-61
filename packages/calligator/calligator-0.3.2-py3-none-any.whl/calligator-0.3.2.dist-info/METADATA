# Calligator

An easy-to-use library for calibrating cameras in python

The calibration library should follow these requirements:
- [x] be able to detect points from checkerboard or charuco board easily
- [x] save intermediate points somewhere, so that optimization can restart quickly
- [x] optimize extrinsics and intrinsics jointly using LM method
- [x] start with opencv intrinsics calibration if possible
- [x] support calibration with arbitrary correspondence points using bundle adjustment
- [ ] output common diagnostics for calibration
  - reprojection error
  - length of checkerboard grids
  - picture of calibrated camera positions
  - undistorted images to check intrinsics
- [x] triangulation functions
- [x] end to end function to calibrate full set of cameras from list of videos

Nice to haves
- [x] reject outlier points
- [x] add objective in optimization to match the object points of calibration board
