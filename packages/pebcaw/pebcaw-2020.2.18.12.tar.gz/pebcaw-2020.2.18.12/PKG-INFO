        PEBCAW (Problem Exists Between Computer And World) monitors internet
        connection security by comparing the observed IP or country with a
        whitelist of VPN and Tor IPs or a whitelist of countries. It notifies if
        the IP or country is not whitelisted, and optionally can notify if the
        IP is in a SIGINT country, and optionally can display observed IP
        details continuously.
