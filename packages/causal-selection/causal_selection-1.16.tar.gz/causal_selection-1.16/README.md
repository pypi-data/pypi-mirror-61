# Causal selection 

This package has two interfaces:

(1) **score_vocab**. Given text, vocab, outcomes, and confounds, the algorithm scores each word according to how well it explains the outcome, _controlling for confounds_. 

(2) **evaluate_vocab**. Given text, vocab, outcomes, and confounds, this algorithm evaluates the overall ability of the entire vocab in explaining the outcome, _controlling for counfounds_.

This package is based on the following papers:

1. _Deconfounded Lexicon Induction for Interpretable Social Science_ [(Pryzant, et al. 2019)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/pryzant2018lexicon.pdf)
2. _Interpretable Neural Architectures for Attributing an Adâ€™s Performance to its Writing Style_ [(Pryzant, et al. 2019)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/pryzant2018emnlp.pdf)



## Install

```
$ pip3 install causal-selection
```

More info here: https://pypi.org/project/causal-selection/1.15/

## Test

You can use `test.py` and the included data to run an integration test.

```
$ python3 test.py
```
No output means the test passed. This file also contains example usage.

## Example

Let's say we have a file, `descriptions.csv`, which contains product descriptions for Nike and Addidas shoes:


| Description   | Brand   | Sales |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| buy shoes !     | addidas | 15    |
| fresh nike shoes !  | nike    | 35    |
| nice nike shoes ! | nike    | 17    |


We want to find the words that are most predictive of sales. Running a regression might give us `nike`, but this isn't super helpful, because brand names like "nike" are merely a function of confounding circumstance rather than a part of the writing style. We want the importance of each word while controlling for the influence of brand. The `score_vocab` function lets us do this:

```
import causal_selection
importance_scores = causal_selection.score_vocab(
	vocab=['buy', 'now' '!', 'nike', 'fresh', 'nice'],
	csv="descriptions.csv"
	name_to_type={
		'Description': 'input',
		'Brand': 'control',
		'Sales': 'predict',
	})
```

`importance_scores` will contain a list of `(word, score)` tuples.

If we want to evaluate the overal ability of our vocabulary's ability to make causal inferences about sales, we can use . `evaluate_vocab`:

```
import causal_selection
informativeness = causal_selection.evaluate_vocab(
	vocab=['buy', 'now' '!', 'nike', 'fresh', 'nice'],
	csv="descriptions.csv"
	name_to_type={
		'Description': 'input',
		'Brand': 'control',
		'Sales': 'predict',
	})
```
`informativeness` will be a float that reflects the vocabulary's abiltiy to predict sales, _beyond_ the brand's ability to predict sales.

    df=None,
    name_to_type={},
    scoring_model="residualization",
    batch_size=128, train_steps=5000, lr=0.001,  hidden_size=32, max_seq_len=128,
    status_bar=False):
    """
    Score words in their ability to explain outcome(s), regaurdless of confound(s).

    Args:
        vocab: list(str). The vocabulary to use. Include n-grams
            by including space-serated multi-token elements
            in this list. For example, "hello world" would be a bigram.
        csv: str. Path to a csv of data. The column corresponding to 
            your "input" variable needs to be pre-tokenized text, where
            each token is separated by whitespace.
        delimiter: str. Delimiter to use when reading the csv.
        df: pandas.df. The data we want to iterate over. The columns of
            these data should be a superset of the keys in name_to_type.
        name_to_type: dict. A mapping from variable names to whether they are
            "input", "predict", or "control" variables.
            You can only have one "input" variable (the text).
            You can have 1+ "predict" and 1+ "control" variables,
                and they can be categorical or numerical datatypes.
        scoring_model: string. The type of model to score. One of
            ["residualization", "adversarial"]
        batch_size: int. Batch size for the scoring model.
        train_steps: int. How long to train the scoring model for.
        lr: float. Learning rate for the scoring model.
        hidden_size: int. Dimension of scoring model vectors.
        max_seq_len: int. Maximum length of text sequences.
        status_bar: bool. Whether to show status bars during model training.

    Returns:
        variable name => class name => [(feature name, score)] 
        Note that the lists are sorted in descending order.
	"score" means how important each feature is for that level of the outcome.

 ```
Note that the arguments to `evaluate_vocab` are largely the same as `score_vocab`. 


### Tips

* For a continuous variable X, give the algorithm _log(X)_ instead of just X.
* The algorithm is sensitive to hyperparameter settings (number of training steps, hidden dimension, etc). Try several different settings to get the best scores possible.
