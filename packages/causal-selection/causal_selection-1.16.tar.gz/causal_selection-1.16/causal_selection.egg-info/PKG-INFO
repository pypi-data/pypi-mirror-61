Description: 
        This package has two interfaces:
        
        (1) score_vocab(): Given text (T), vocab (V), outcome(s) Y, and 
            confound(s) (C), this method will score each element of the
            vocab according to how well it explains each Y, controlling 
            for all of the C's.
        
        (2) evaluate_vocab(): Measure's the strength of a vocab's causal
            effects on Y (controlling for C).
