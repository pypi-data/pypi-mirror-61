# pyFUME

A Python library for automatical Fuzzy Model Estimation from data. pyFUME contains a set of classes and methods to estimate the antecedent sets and the consequent parameters of a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model from data, and then create an executable fuzzy model exploiting the Simpful library. 
pyFUME can be beneficial to practitioners, thanks to its pre-implemented and user-friendly pipelines, but also to researchers that want to fine-tune each step of the estimation process.
