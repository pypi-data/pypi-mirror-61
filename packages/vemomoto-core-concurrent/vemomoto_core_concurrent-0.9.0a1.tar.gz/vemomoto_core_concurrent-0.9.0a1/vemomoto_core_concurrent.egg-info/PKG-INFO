Description: # Vector Movement Modelling Tools - Necessary Tools for Concurrent Computing
        
        This package contains modules simplifying multiprocessing and the work with
        shared memmory in the classical C-Python. The modules have been originally 
        developed to facilitate the implementation of a vector movement model but 
        may have broader use cases.
