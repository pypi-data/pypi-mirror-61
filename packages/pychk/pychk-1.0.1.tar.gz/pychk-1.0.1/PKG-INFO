Description: # Pychk
        
        Pychk is a tool to help developers identify vulnerable dependencies being used in their project. It reads the project's dependencies from the specified file (which is usually `requirements.txt`) and checks the entries in it against entries in a database of packages with known vulnerabilities associated with them.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Pychk can be easily installed with PIP with the following command:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install pychk
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Pychk reads the project dependencies from the file specified by the user (by default, Pychk will look for 'requirements.txt' in the current directory). It can also, optionally, write the output to a specified file in JSON format.
        
        * Running Pychk with defaults:
        
        ```bash
        pychk
        ```
        
        * Running Pychk against a specific file:
        
        ```bash
        pychk [-p/--path <path to file>]
        ```
        
        * Writing the output to a file:
        
        ```bash
        pychk [-o/--out-file <file>]
        ```
        
        * Displaying help:
        
        ```bash
        pychk -h/--help
        ```
