        **DESCRIPTION**
        
        Outliers are extreme values that deviate from other observations on data , they may indicate a variability in a measurement, experimental errors or a novelty. Outliers can be of two kinds: univariate and multivariate. Univariate outliers can be found when looking at a distribution of values in a single feature space. Multivariate outliers can be found in a n-dimensional space (of n-features). Outliers can also come in different flavours, depending on the environment: point outliers, contextual outliers, or collective outliers. Point outliers are single data points that lay far from the rest of the distribution. Contextual outliers can be noise in data, such as punctuation symbols when realizing text analysis or background noise signal when doing speech recognition. Collective outliers can be subsets of novelties in data such as a signal that may indicate the discovery of new phenomena.
        
        **Most common causes of outliers on a data set:**
        
        1) Data entry errors (human errors)
        
        2) Measurement errors (instrument errors)
        
        3) Experimental errors (data extraction or experiment planning/executing errors)
        
        4) Intentional (dummy outliers made to test detection methods)
        
        5) Data processing errors (data manipulation or data set unintended mutations)
        
        6) Sampling errors (extracting or mixing data from wrong or various sources)
        
        7) Natural (not an error, novelties in data)
        
        **Ways of finding an outlier:**
        
        1) Box plot
        
        2) Scatter plot
        
        3) Interquartile Range
        
        4) Z score
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install OUTLIER_101703292.
        
        ```bash
        pip install OUTLIER_101703292
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Enter csv filename followed by .csv extentsion
        
        ```python
        OUTLIER_101703292 data.csv 
        ```
        
        
        ## Constraint 
        *Your csv file should not have categorical data*
