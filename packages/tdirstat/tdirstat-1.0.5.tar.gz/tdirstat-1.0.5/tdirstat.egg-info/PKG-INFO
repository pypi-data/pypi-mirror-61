        ========
        
        Terminal-based directory statistics with a nice TUI and quick actionable information
        
        **Overview**
        
        This project is inspired by projects such as kdirstat and qdirstat.
        Easily find where your disk space has gone, without waiting for a full-drive scan
        to complete. 
        
        Contributions welcome!
        
        **Installation**
        
        .. code::
        
            pip install --user setuptools tdirstat@git+https://github.com/apockill/tdirstat
        
        
        
        Then, to run:
        .. code::
        
            tdirstat /
        
        
        The first argument is the directory you wish to map. By default, it picks the current working directory. 
        
        **Repository goals**
        
        - Reduce memory usage
        - Speed up scan time
        - Add tooling for file and directory deletion
