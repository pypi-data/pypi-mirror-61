maildirproc \- filter emails in local Maildirs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
maildirproc \-m <maildir> [\-m <maildir> ... ] [options]
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
maildirproc continuously monitors one or more maildirs and processes
mail in them according to logic in an \f[I]rc file\f[R], a user defined
piece of Python code.
It also logs its actions to a log file.
By default maildirproc operates continuously: when there is no more mail
to process, maildirproc sleeps one second and then checks again.
And so on.
To make maildirproc exit after the first filtering run, pass the
\-\-once option.
.PP
maildirproc keeps a list of maildir directories to process.
At least one maildir directory must be specified for maildirproc to run.
A maildir directory path can be absolute (starting with a slash) or
non\-absolute.
In the latter case, it will be considered relative to the \f[I]maildir
base directory\f[R], which defaults to the current working directory.
There are two ways to specify this information: by passing command line
options, or by setting attributes on the processor object in the rc
file.
The rc file has priority over the command line options.
.PP
In a Maildir++\-style setup, the maildir base directory should typically
be set to \[ti]/Maildir and the maildir list should include the
directory .
to make maildirproc process the inbox.
.PP
The default location of the rc file for maildirproc is
\f[C]\[ti]/.mailprocessing/maildir.rc\f[R] and the default location of
its log file is \f[C]\[ti]/.mailprocessing/log\-maildir\f[R].
.PP
imapproc can optionally reload the rc file whenever a modification is
detected (that is, the file\[aq]s mtime has changed).
This automatic reloading is turned off by default and can be enabled
either by passing the \f[C]\-\-auto\-reload\-rcfile\f[R] command line
option or by setting the \f[C]auto_reload_rcfile\f[R] property to
\f[C]True\f[R] on the processor object in the rc file.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Common options
.PP
maildirproc and imapproc both take the following common command line
options:
.TP
.B \-\-version
show program\[aq]s version number and exit
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
show this help message and exit
.TP
.B \-\-auto\-reload\-rcfile
turn on automatic reloading of the rc file when it has been modified
.TP
.B \-\-dry\-run
just log what should have been done; implies \-\-once
.TP
.B \-l FILE, \-\-logfile=FILE
send log to FILE instead of the default (\[ti]/.maildirproc/log\-imap
for imapproc and \[ti]/.maildirproc/log\-maildir for maildirproc).
If you are running multiple maildirproc or imapproc instances, you must
specify a dedicated log file for each of these.
.TP
.B \-\-log\-level=INTEGER
only include log messages with this log level or lower; defaults to 1
.TP
.B \-\-once
only process the maildirs once and then exit; without this flag,
maildirproc will scan the maildirs continuously
.TP
.B \-r FILE, \-\-rcfile=FILE
use the given rc file instead of the default
(\[ti]/.maildirproc/default.rc)
.TP
.B \-\-test
test mode; implies \-\-dry\-run, \-\-once, \-\-logfile=\- and
\-\-verbose
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
increase log level one step
.SS maildirproc specific options
.PP
The following options are specific to maildirproc:
.TP
.B \-m DIRECTORY, \-\-maildir=DIRECTORY
add DIRECTORY to the set of maildir directories to process (can be
passed multiple times); if DIRECTORY is relative, it will be considered
relative to the maildir base directory
.TP
.B \-b DIRECTORY, \-\-maildir\-base=DIRECTORY
set maildir base directory; defaults to the current working directory
.TP
.B \-p PREFIX, \-\-folder\-prefix
prefix Maildir names with PREFIX; defaults to \[aq].\[aq]
.TP
.B \-s SEP, \-\-folder\-separator=SEP
use sep as a folder separator in maildir names; defaults to \[aq].\[aq].
List style folder names passed to create_folder() will be joined by this
character, e.g.
[\[dq]github\[dq], \[dq]jrosdahl\[dq], \[dq]maildirproc\[dq]] will
become \[dq].github.jrosdahl.maildirproc.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
For some mailprocessing configuration examples, see the examples
directory.
You will also find sample logrotate configuration files for
mailprocessing in there.
.SH SIGNALS
.PP
SIGHUP will cause imapproc to close and re\-open its log file.
This can be used for online log rotation in continuous mode.
