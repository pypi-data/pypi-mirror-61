        If the `pre-commit` Python package is installed, you can set up `pre-commit` hooks for automatic code formatting via
        
            pre-commit install
        
        You can also invoke the pre-commit hook manually at any time with
        
            pre-commit run
        
        Automatic code formatting has been adopted for `linalg_for_datasci` to make it unnecessary for contributors to worry about their code style.
        As long as the code is valid, the pre-commit hook should take care of how the code should look.
        
        There are also plugins to [integrate the `black` code autoformatter into your favorite code editor](https://github.com/psf/black#editor-integration). This way you can format code automatically.
        
        If you have already committed files before setting up the pre-commit hook with `pre-commit install`, you can fix everything up using `pre-commit run --all-files`. You need to make the fixing commit yourself after that.
