Access to HttpRequest
=====================

RPC4Django allows RPC methods to be written in such a way that they have
access to Django's HttpRequest_ object. This can be used
to see the type of request, the user making the request or any specific
headers in the request object. To use this, the first argument have to be
named "request" like classic django view function.

.. _HttpRequest: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/

::

 @rpcmethod(name='rpc4django.httprequest',signature=['string'])
 def httprequest(request):
     '''
     Illustrates access to the HttpRequest object
     '''
     
     return str(request)
