'''The `peptml` package implements a hierarchical density-based clustering
algorithm for general Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT).

The PEPT-ML algorithm [1] works using the following steps:
    1. Split the data into a series of individual "samples", each containing
    a given number of LoRs. Use the base class pept.LineData for this.
    2. For every sample of LoRs, compute the *cutpoints*, or the points in
    space that minimise the distance to every pair of lines.
    3. Cluster every sample using HDBSCAN and extract the centres of the
    clusters ("1-pass clustering").
    4. Splirt the centres into samples of a given size.
    5. Cluster every sample of centres using HDBSCAN and extract the centres
    of the clusters ("2-pass clustering").
    6. Construct the trajectory of every particle using the centres from the
    previous step.

A typical workflow for using the `peptml` package would be:
    1. Read the LoRs into a `pept.LineData` class instance and set the
    `sample_size` and `overlap` appropriately.
    2. Compute the cutpoints using the `pept.tracking.peptml.Cutpoints` class.
    3. Instantiate an `pept.tracking.peptml.HDBSCANClusterer` class and cluster
    the cutpoints found previously.

More tutorials and examples can be found on the University of Birmingham
Positron Imaging Centre's GitHub repository.

PEPT-ML was successfuly used at the University of Birmingham to analyse real
Fluorine-18 tracers in air.

def find_cutpoints_sample(sample, max_distance, cutoffs = None):
    '''Find the cutpoints in a sample of LoRs.

    A cutpoint is the point in 3D space that minimises the distance between any
    two lines. For any two non-parallel 3D lines, this point corresponds to
    half the distance between the two lines and is unique.

    This function considers every pair of lines in `sample_lines` and returns
    all the cutpoints that satisfy the following conditions:
        1. The distance between the two lines is smaller than `max_distance`.
        2. The cutpoints is within the `cutoffs`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : (N, 7) numpy.ndarray
        A sample of LoRs, where each row is `[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2]`,
        such that every line is defined by the points `[x1, y1, z1]` and
        `[x2, y2, z2]`.
    max_distance : float
        The maximum distance between any pair of lines so that their cutpoint
        will be considered.
    cutoffs : list, optional
        The cutoffs for each dimension, formatted as `[x_min, x_max,
        y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max]`. If not defined, they are computed
        automatically by calling `get_cutoffs`. The default is `None`.

    Returns
    -------
    sample_cutpoints : (N, 4) numpy.ndarray
        The computed cutpoints for the given LoRs, where each row is
        formatted as `[time, x, y, z]` for every cutpoint.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If `sample` is not a numpy array with shape (N, 7).
    TypeError

class Cutpoints(pept.PointData):
    '''A class that transforms LoRs into *cutpoints* for clustering.

    The `Cutpoints` class transforms LoRs (individual numpy arrays or full `LineData`)
    into cutpoints (individual numpy arrays or full `PointData`) that can then be passed
    to `HDBSCANClusterer`.

    Under typical usage, the class is instantiated with the LoR data (required to be
    an instance of `LineData`) and transforms it into an instance of `PointData` that
    stores the found cutpoints.

    For more control over the operations, the class also provides a static method (i.e.
    it can be used without instantiating the class) `find_cutpoints_sample` that
    receives a generic numpy array of LoRs (one 'sample') and returns a numpy array
    of cutpoints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    line_data : instance of pept.LineData
        The LoRs for which the cutpoints will be computed. It is required to be an
        instance of `pept.LineData`.
    max_distance : float
        The maximum distance between any two lines so that their cutpoint will be
        considered.
    cutoffs : list-like of length 6, optional
        A list (or equivalent) of the cutoff distances for every axis, formatted as
        [x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max]. Only consider the cutpoints which
        fall within these cutoff distances. The default is None, in which case they
        are automatically computed using `get_cutoffs`.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Provide extra information when computing the cutpoints: time the operation
        and show a progress bar. The default is `True`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    line_data : instance of pept.LineData
        The LoRs for which the cutpoints will be computed. It is required to be an
        instance of `pept.LineData`.
    max_distance : float
        The maximum distance between any two lines so that their cutpoint will be
        considered.
    cutoffs : list-like of length 6
        A list (or equivalent) of the cutoff distances for every axis, formatted as
        [x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max]. Only consider the cutpoints which
        fall within these cutoff distances.
    sample_size, overlap, number_of_lines, etc. : inherited from pept.PointData
        Extra attributes and methods are inherited from the base class `PointData`.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If `line_data` is not an instance of `pept.LineData`.
    TypeError
        If `cutoffs` is not a one-dimensional array with values formatted as
        `[min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z]`.

    Example usage
    -------------
    Compute the cutpoints for a `LineData` instance:
        >>> line_data = pept.LineData(example_data)
        >>> cutpts = peptml.Cutpoints(line_data, 0.1)

    Compute the cutpoints for a single sample:
        >>> sample = line_data[0]
        >>> cutpts_sample = peptml.find_cutpoints_sample(sample)

        (optionally) the labelled cutpoints.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sample : (N, M >= 4) numpy.ndarray
            The sample of points that will be clustered. Every point corresponds to
            a row and is formatted as `[time, x, y, z, etc]`. Only columns `[1, 2, 3]`
            are used for clustering.
        store_labels : bool, optional
            If set to True, the clustered cutpoints are returned along with the centres
            of the clusters. Setting it to False speeds up the clustering. The default
            is False.
        noise : bool, optional
            If set to True, the clustered cutpoints also include the points classified
            as noise. Only has an effect if `store_labels` is set to True. The default
            is False.
        as_array : bool, optional
            If set to True, the centres of the clusters and the clustered cutpoints are
            returned as numpy arrays. If set to False, they are returned inside
            instances of `pept.PointData`.
        verbose : bool, optional
            Provide extra information when computing the cutpoints: time the operation
            and show a progress bar. The default is `False`.

        Returns
        -------
        centres : numpy.ndarray or pept.PointData
            The centroids of every cluster found. They are computed as the average
            of every column of `[time, x, y, z, etc]` of the clustered points. Another
            column is added to the initial data in `sample`, signifying the cluster
            size - the number of points included in the cluster. If `as_array` is
            set to True, it is a numpy array, otherwise the centres are stored
            in a pept.PointData instance.
        clustered_cutpoints : numpy.ndarray or pept.PointData
            The points in `sample` that fall in every cluster. A new column is added
            to the points in `sample` that signifies the label of cluster that the
            point was associated with: all points in cluster number 3 will have the
            number 3 as the last element in their row. The points classified as noise
            have the number -1 associated. If `as_array` is set to True, it is a numpy
