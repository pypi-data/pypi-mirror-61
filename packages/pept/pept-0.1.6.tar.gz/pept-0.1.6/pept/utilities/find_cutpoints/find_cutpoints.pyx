cpdef find_cutpoints(
    double[:, :] sample_lines,
    double max_distance,
    double[:] cutoffs
):
    '''Compute the cutpoints from a given array of lines.

    Function signature:
        find_cutpoints(
            double[:, :] sample_lines,
            double max_distance,
            double[:] cutoffs
        )

    A cutpoint is the point in 3D space that minimises the distance between any
    two lines. For any two non-parallel 3D lines, this point corresponds to
    half the distance between the two lines and is unique.

    This function considers every pair of lines in `sample_lines` and returns
    all the cutpoints that satisfy the following conditions:
        1. The distance between the two lines is smaller than `max_distance`.
        2. The cutpoints is within the `cutoffs`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_lines : (N, 7) numpy.ndarray
        The sample of lines, where each row is [time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2],
        containing two points [x1, y1, z1] and [x2, y2, z2] defining an LoR.
    max_distance : float
        The maximum distance between two LoRs for their cutpoint to be considered
    cutoffs : (6,) numpy.ndarray
        Only consider the cutpoints that fall within the cutoffs. `cutoffs` has
        the format [min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z]

    Returns
    -------
    cutpoints : (M, 4) numpy.ndarray
        A numpy array of the found cutpoints, where each row is [time, x, y, z] for
        the cutpoint. The time is the average between the two LoRs that were used
        to compute the cutpoint. The first column (for time) is sorted.

    Example usage
    -------------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from pept.utilities import find_cutpoints
    >>>
    >>> lines = np.random.random((500, 7)) * 500
    >>> max_distance = 0.1
    >>> cutoffs = np.array([0, 500, 0, 500, 0, 500], dtype = float)
    >>>
    >>> cutpoints = find_cutpoints(lines, max_distance, cutoffs)
