class PointData:
    '''A class for generic PEPT data iteration, manipulation and visualisation.

    This class is used to encapsulate points. Unlike `LineData`, it does not have
    any restriction on the maximum number of columns it can store. It can yield
    samples of the `point_data` of an adaptive `sample_size` and `overlap`,
    without requiring additional storage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    point_data : (N, M) numpy.ndarray
        An (N, M >= 4) numpy array that stores points (or any generic 2D set of
        data). It expects that the first column is time, followed by cartesian
        (3D) coordinates of points **in mm**, followed by any extra information
        the user needs. A row is then [time, x, y, z, etc].
    sample_size : int, optional
        An `int`` that defines the number of points that should be
        returned when iterating over `point_data`. A `sample_size` of 0
        yields all the data as one single sample. (Default is 200)
    overlap : int, optional
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive
        samples that are returned when iterating over `point_data`.
        An overlap of 0 means consecutive samples, while an overlap
        of (`sample_size` - 1) means incrementing the samples by one.
        A negative overlap means skipping values between samples. An
        error is raised if `overlap` is larger than or equal to
        `sample_size`. (Default is 0)
    verbose : bool, optional
        An option that enables printing the time taken for the
        initialisation of an instance of the class. Useful when
        reading large files (10gb files for PEPT data is not unheard
        of). (Default is True)

    Attributes
    ----------
    point_data : (N, M) numpy.ndarray
        An (N, M >= 4) numpy array that stores the points as time, followed by
        cartesian (3D) coordinates of the point **in mm**, followed by any extra
        information. Each row is then `[time, x, y, z, etc]`.
    sample_size : int
        An `int` that defines the number of lines that should be
        returned when iterating over `point_data`. (Default is 200)
    overlap : int
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive
        samples that are returned when iterating over `point_data`.
        An overlap of 0 means consecutive samples, while an overlap
        of (`sample_size` - 1) means incrementing the samples by one.
        A negative overlap means skipping values between samples. It
        is required to be smaller than `sample_size`. (Default is 0)
    number_of_points : int
        An `int` that corresponds to len(`point_data`), or the number of
        points stored by `point_data`.
    number_of_samples : int
        An `int` that corresponds to the number of samples that can be
        accessed from the class, taking the `overlap` into consideration.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `overlap` >= `sample_size`. Overlap is required to be smaller
        than `sample_size`, unless `sample_size` is 0. Note that it can
        also be negative.
    ValueError
        If `line_data` does not have (N, M) shape, where M >= 4.

    Notes
    -----
    The class saves `point_data` as a **contiguous** numpy array for
    efficient access in C extensions.

        plotly.graph_objects.Scatter3d
            A `plotly.graph_objects.Scatter3d` trace of all points.

        Note
        ----
        Plotting all points in the case of large LoR arrays is *very*
        computationally intensive. For large arrays (> 10000), plotting
        individual samples using `points_sample_n_traces` is recommended.

        Returns a `plotly.graph_objects.Scatter3d` trace containing all points
        included in in the samples selected by `sample_indices`. `sample_indices`
        can be a single sample index (e.g. 0) or an iterable of indices (e.g.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sample_indices : int or iterable
            The index or indices of the samples of LoRs. The default is 0 (the first sample).
        size : float
            The marker size of the points. The default is 2.
        color : str or list-like
            Can be a single color (e.g. "black", "rgb(122, 15, 241)") or a colorbar list.
            Is ignored if `colorbar` is set to True. For more information, check the Plotly
            documentation. The default is None.
        opacity : float
            The opacity of the lines, where 0 is transparent and 1 is fully
            opaque. The default is 0.8.
        colorbar : bool
            If set to True, will color-code the data in the sample column `colorbar_col`.
            Overrides `color` if set to True. The default is False.
        colorbar_col : int
            The column in the data samples that will be used to color the points. Only has
            an effect if `colorbar` is set to True. The default is -1 (the last column).
        colorbar_title : str
            If set, the colorbar will have this title above. The default is None.

        Returns
        -------
        plotly.graph_objs.Scatter3d
            A Plotly trace of the points.
