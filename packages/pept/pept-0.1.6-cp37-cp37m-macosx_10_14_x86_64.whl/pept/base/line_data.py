class LineData:
    '''A class for PEPT LoR data iteration, manipulation and visualisation.

    Generally, PEPT LoRs are lines in 3D space, each defined by two points,
    irrespective of the geometry of the scanner used. This class is used
    for LoRs (or any lines!) encapsulation. It can yield samples of the
    `line_data` of an adaptive `sample_size` and `overlap`, without requiring
    additional storage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    line_data : (N, 7) numpy.ndarray
        An (N, 7) numpy array that stores the PEPT LoRs (or any generic set of
        lines) as time and cartesian (3D) coordinates of two points defining each
        line, **in mm**. A row is then [time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2].
    sample_size : int, optional
        An `int`` that defines the number of lines that should be
        returned when iterating over `line_data`. A `sample_size` of 0
        yields all the data as one single sample. (Default is 200)
    overlap : int, optional
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive
        samples that are returned when iterating over `line_data`.
        An overlap of 0 means consecutive samples, while an overlap
        of (`sample_size` - 1) means incrementing the samples by one.
        A negative overlap means skipping values between samples. An
        error is raised if `overlap` is larger than or equal to
        `sample_size`. (Default is 0)
    verbose : bool, optional
        An option that enables printing the time taken for the
        initialisation of an instance of the class. Useful when
        reading large files (10gb files for PEPT data is not unheard
        of). (Default is True)

    Attributes
    ----------
    line_data : (N, 7) numpy.ndarray
        An (N, 7) numpy array that stores the PEPT LoRs as time and
        cartesian (3D) coordinates of two points defining a line, **in mm**.
        Each row is then `[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2]`.
    sample_size : int
        An `int` that defines the number of lines that should be
        returned when iterating over `line_data`. (Default is 200)
    overlap : int
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive
        samples that are returned when iterating over `line_data`.
        An overlap of 0 means consecutive samples, while an overlap
        of (`sample_size` - 1) means incrementing the samples by one.
        A negative overlap means skipping values between samples. It
        is required to be smaller than `sample_size`. (Default is 0)
    number_of_lines : int
        An `int` that corresponds to len(`line_data`), or the number of
        LoRs stored by `line_data`.
    number_of_samples : int
        An `int` that corresponds to the number of samples that can be
        accessed from the class. It takes `overlap` into consideration.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `overlap` >= `sample_size` unless `sample_size` is 0. Overlap
        has to be smaller than `sample_size`. Note that it can also be negative.
    ValueError
        If `line_data` does not have (N, 7) shape.

    Notes
    -----
    The class saves `line_data` as a **contiguous** numpy array for
    efficient access in C functions. It should not be changed after
    instantiating the class.

        [1,5,6]).
        Can then be passed to the `plotly.graph_objects.figure.add_trace`
        function or a `PlotlyGrapher` instance using the `add_trace` method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sample_indices : int or iterable
            The index or indices of the samples of LoRs.
        width : float
            The width of the lines. The default is 2.
        color : str or list-like
            Can be a single color (e.g. "black", "rgb(122, 15, 241)") or a colorbar list.
            Is ignored if `colorbar` is set to True. For more information, check the Plotly
            documentation. The default is None.
        opacity : float
            The opacity of the lines, where 0 is transparent and 1 is fully
            opaque. The default is 0.6.
        colorbar : bool
            If set to True, will color-code the data in the sample column `colorbar_col`.
            Overrides `color` if set to True. The default is True, so that every line has
            a different color.
        colorbar_col : int
            The column in the data samples that will be used to color the points. Only has
            an effect if `colorbar` is set to True. The default is 0 (the first column - time).
        colorbar_title : str
            If set, the colorbar will have this title above. The default is None.

        Returns
        -------
        plotly.graph_objs.Scatter3d
            A Plotly trace of the LoRs.
