# *MGEfinder* - A toolbox for identifying mobile genetic element (MGE) insertions from short-read sequencing data of bacterial isolates.

The command-line tool *MGEfinder* identifies large insertions and genotypes them with respect to a reference genome.

It is designed to work with haploid genomes, and has been tested extensively on bacteria.

It can identify mobile genetic elements and their sites of insertion using an *ab initio* approach.
