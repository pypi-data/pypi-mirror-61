===================================
Foolbox Native (a.k.a. Foolbox 3.0)
===================================

Foolbox Native will be the next big release of Foolbox, completely rewritten from the ground up for maximum performance. You can now check out our  `preview <https://github.com/jonasrauber/foolbox-native>`_ version.

===========
Foolbox 2.0
===========

Foolbox is a Python toolbox to create adversarial examples that fool neural networks. It requires `Python`, `NumPy` and `SciPy`.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install foolbox


Documentation
-------------

Documentation for the `latest stable version <https://foolbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ as well as
`pre-release versions <https://foolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is available on ReadTheDocs.

Our paper describing Foolbox is on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04131

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

   import foolbox
   import numpy as np
   import torchvision.models as models

   # instantiate model (supports PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow (Graph and Eager), JAX, MXNet and many more)
   model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True).eval()
   preprocessing = dict(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225], axis=-3)
   fmodel = foolbox.models.PyTorchModel(model, bounds=(0, 1), num_classes=1000, preprocessing=preprocessing)

   # get a batch of images and labels and print the accuracy
   images, labels = foolbox.utils.samples(dataset='imagenet', batchsize=16, data_format='channels_first', bounds=(0, 1))
   print(np.mean(fmodel.forward(images).argmax(axis=-1) == labels))
   # -> 0.9375

   # apply the attack
   attack = foolbox.attacks.FGSM(fmodel)
   adversarials = attack(images, labels)
   # if the i'th image is misclassfied without a perturbation, then adversarials[i] will be the same as images[i]
   # if the attack fails to find an adversarial for the i'th image, then adversarials[i] will all be np.nan

   # Foolbox guarantees that all returned adversarials are in fact in adversarials
   print(np.mean(fmodel.forward(adversarials).argmax(axis=-1) == labels))
   # -> 0.0


.. code-block:: python

   # In rare cases, it can happen that attacks return adversarials that are so close to the decision boundary,
   # that they actually might end up on the other (correct) side if you pass them through the model again like
   # above to get the adversarial class. This is because models are not numerically deterministic (on GPU, some
   # operations such as `sum` are non-deterministic by default) and indepedent between samples (an input might
   # be classified differently depending on the other inputs in the same batch).

   # You can always get the actual adversarial class that was observed for that sample by Foolbox by
   # passing `unpack=False` to get the actual `Adversarial` objects:
   attack = foolbox.attacks.FGSM(fmodel, distance=foolbox.distances.Linf)
   adversarials = attack(images, labels, unpack=False)

   adversarial_classes = np.asarray([a.adversarial_class for a in adversarials])
   print(labels)
   print(adversarial_classes)
   print(np.mean(adversarial_classes == labels))  # will always be 0.0

   # The `Adversarial` objects also provide a `distance` attribute. Note that the distances
   # can be 0 (misclassified without perturbation) and inf (attack failed).
   distances = np.asarray([a.distance.value for a in adversarials])
   print("{:.1e}, {:.1e}, {:.1e}".format(distances.min(), np.median(distances), distances.max()))
   print("{} of {} attacks failed".format(sum(adv.distance.value == np.inf for adv in adversarials), len(adversarials)))
   print("{} of {} inputs misclassified without perturbation".format(sum(adv.distance.value == 0 for adv in adversarials), len(adversarials)))


For more examples, have a look at the `documentation <https://foolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/examples.html>`__.

Finally, the result can be plotted like this:

.. code-block:: python

   # if you use Jupyter notebooks
   %matplotlib inline

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   image = images[0]
   adversarial = attack(images[:1], labels[:1])[0]

   # CHW to HWC
   image = image.transpose(1, 2, 0)
   adversarial = adversarial.transpose(1, 2, 0)

   plt.figure()

   plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
   plt.title('Original')
   plt.imshow(image)
   plt.axis('off')

   plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
   plt.title('Adversarial')
   plt.imshow(adversarial)
   plt.axis('off')

   plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
   plt.title('Difference')
   difference = adversarial - image
   plt.imshow(difference / abs(difference).max() * 0.2 + 0.5)
   plt.axis('off')

   plt.show()

Interfaces for a range of other deeplearning packages such as TensorFlow 1 and 2,
PyTorch, JAX, Theano, Lasagne and MXNet are available, e.g.

.. code-block:: python

   model = foolbox.models.TensorFlowModel(images, logits, bounds=(0, 255))  # Use this for TensorFlow 1.0
   model = foolbox.models.TensorFlowEagerModel(model, bounds=(0, 255))  # Use this for TensorFlow 2.0
   model = foolbox.models.PyTorchModel(torchmodel, bounds=(0, 255), num_classes=1000)
   # etc.

Different adversarial criteria such as Top-k, specific target classes or target probability
values for the original class or the target class can be passed to the attack, e.g.

.. code-block:: python

   criterion = foolbox.criteria.TargetClass(22)
   attack    = foolbox.attacks.LBFGSAttack(fmodel, criterion)

Feature requests and bug reports
--------------------------------

We welcome feature requests and bug reports. Just create a new issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox/issues/new>`__.

Questions & FAQ
---------------

Depending on the nature of your question feel free to post it as an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox/issues/new>`__, or post it as a question on `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com>`_ using the `foolbox` tag. We will try to monitor that tag but if you don't get an answer don't hesitate to contact us.

Before you post a question, please check our `FAQ <https://foolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/faq.html>`__ and our Documentation on `ReadTheDocs <https://foolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__.

Contributions welcome
----------------------

Foolbox is a work in progress and any input is welcome.
Foolbox is particularly well-suited to develop
`new adversarial attacks <https://foolbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/development.html#new-adversarial-attacks>`_
and to support new machine learning and deep learning frameworks by simply adding a wrapper.
By adding reference implementations for adversarial attacks to Foolbox, they will automatically be applicable
to models implemented in any of the supported frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, JAX or MxNet.
