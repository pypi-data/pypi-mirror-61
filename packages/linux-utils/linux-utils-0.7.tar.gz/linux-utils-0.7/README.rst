The Python package `linux-utils` provides utility functions that make it easy
to script system administration tasks on Linux_ systems in Python. The
following functionality is currently implemented:

- Parsing of the `/etc/fstab`_ and `/etc/crypttab`_ configuration files.
- A basic Python API for cryptsetup_ and a Python implementation of
  cryptdisks_start_ and cryptdisks_stop_ (with a command line interface).
- Atomic filesystem operations for Linux in Python.
- Simple network location awareness / discovery.

The package is currently tested on cPython 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and PyPy
(2.7) on Ubuntu Linux (using `Travis CI`_).

Installation
------------

The `linux-utils` package is available on PyPI_ which means installation should
be as simple as:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install linux-utils

There's actually a multitude of ways to install Python packages (e.g. the `per
user site-packages directory`_, `virtual environments`_ or just installing
system wide) and I have no intention of getting into that discussion here, so
if this intimidates you then read up on your options before returning to these
instructions ðŸ˜‰.

Usage
-----

For details about the Python API please refer to the API documentation
available on `Read the Docs`_. The Python implementation of cryptdisks_start_
and cryptdisks_stop_ is available on the command line as the following two
programs:

As the names imply these programs are not functional equivalents of their
"official" counterparts, because they only support LUKS encryption and a small
subset of the available encryption options.

cryptdisks-start-fallback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. A DRY solution to avoid duplication of the `cryptdisks-start-fallback --help' text:
..
.. [[[cog
.. import cog
.. from humanfriendly.text import dedent
.. from humanfriendly.usage import render_usage
.. from linux_utils.cli import cryptdisks_start_cli
.. cog.out("\n" + render_usage(dedent(cryptdisks_start_cli.__doc__)) + "\n")
.. ]]]

**Usage:** `cryptdisks-start-fallback NAME`

Reads /etc/crypttab and unlocks the encrypted filesystem with the given NAME.

This program emulates the functionality of Debian's cryptdisks_start program,
but it only supports LUKS encryption and a small subset of the available
encryption options.

.. [[[end]]]

cryptdisks-stop-fallback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. A DRY solution to avoid duplication of the `cryptdisks-stop-fallback --help' text:
..
.. [[[cog
.. import cog
.. from humanfriendly.text import dedent
.. from humanfriendly.usage import render_usage
.. from linux_utils.cli import cryptdisks_stop_cli
.. cog.out("\n" + render_usage(dedent(cryptdisks_stop_cli.__doc__)) + "\n")
.. ]]]

**Usage:** `cryptdisks-stop-fallback NAME`

Reads /etc/crypttab and locks the encrypted filesystem with the given NAME.

This program emulates the functionality of Debian's cryptdisks_stop program,
but it only supports LUKS encryption and a small subset of the available
encryption options.

History
-------

Back in 2015 I wrote some Python code to parse the Linux configuration files
`/etc/fstab`_ and `/etc/crypttab`_ for use in crypto-drive-manager_. Fast
forward to 2017 and I found myself wanting to use the same functionality
in rsync-system-backup_. Three options presented themselves to me:

**Copy/paste the relevant code**
 Having to maintain the same code in multiple places causes lower quality code
 because having to duplicate the effort of writing documentation, developing
 tests and fixing bugs is a very demotivating endeavor. In fact sometime in
 2016 I *did* copy/paste parts of this code into a project at work, because I
 needed similar functionality there. Of course since then the two
 implementations have started diverging ðŸ˜›.

**Make crypto-drive-manager a dependency of rsync-system-backup**
 Although this approach is less ugly than copy/pasting the code, it still isn't
 exactly elegant because the two projects have nothing to do with each other
 apart from working with LUKS encrypted disks on Linux.

**Extract the functionality into a new package**
 In my opinion this is clearly the most elegant approach, unfortunately it also
 requires the most work from me ðŸ˜‡. On the plus side I'm publishing the new
 package with a test suite which means less untested code remains in
 crypto-drive-manager_ (which doesn't have a test suite at the time of
 writing).

While extracting the code I shortly considered integrating the functionality
into debuntu-tools_, however the `/etc/fstab`_ and `/etc/crypttab`_ parsing
isn't specific to Debian or Ubuntu at all and debuntu-tools_ has several
dependencies that aren't relevant to Linux configuration file parsing.

Since then it has become clear that this was a good choice (not merging the
functionality into debuntu-tools_) because `linux-utils` now provides a Python
implementation of cryptdisks_start_ and cryptdisks_stop_, which is mostly
useful on Linux systems that *aren't* based on Debian ðŸ™‚.
