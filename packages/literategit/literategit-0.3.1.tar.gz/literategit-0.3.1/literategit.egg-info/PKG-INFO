Description: # Literate git
        
        This package provides tools to turn a structured git history into an
        interactive web page.  Development history is broken down into
        *sections* and *subsections*, using merge commits.  The resulting web
        page allows the reader to page through the sections, expanding and
        collapsing them as they wish to see more or less detail.
        
        See [the project homepage](https://github.com/bennorth/literate-git)
        for more information and a demo.
