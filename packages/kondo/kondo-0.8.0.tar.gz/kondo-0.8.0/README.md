![Marie Kondo Spark Joy](https://i.imgflip.com/2zdobd.jpg)

The name is inspired by [Marie Kondo](https://konmari.com)'s tidying adventures.

Throw away experiments that don't spark joy with this tiny module.

## Installation

### PyPI

```
pip install kondo
```

### Source

```
pip install git+https://github.com/activatedgeek/kondo.git@master
```

**NOTE**: Prefer pinning to a reference than the master branch for unintended updates.

## Minimal Usage Example

* Create new `Experiment` class
  ```python
  from kondo import Spec, Experiment, RandIntType, ChoiceType

  class MyExp(Experiment):
    def __init__(self, foo=100, bar='c', **kwargs):
      super().__init__(**kwargs)
      self.foo = foo
      self.bar = bar

    def run(self):
      print('Running experiment with foo={}, bar="{}".'.format(self.foo, self.bar))

    @staticmethod
    def spec_list():
      return [
        Spec(
          group='random',
          params=dict(
            foo=RandIntType(low=10, high=100),
            bar=ChoiceType(['a', 'b', 'c'])
          ),
          n_trials=3,
        ),
        Spec(
          group='fixed_foo',
          params=dict(
            foo=200,
            bar=ChoiceType(['a', 'b', 'c'])
          ),
          n_trials=3,
        )
      ]
  ```
  Make sure to capture all keyword arguments to the super class using `**kwargs`
  as above.

* Create `Hyperparameter` spec
  ```python
  from kondo import HParams

  hparams = HParams(MyExp)
  ```
  `HParams` class automagically recognizes all the possible parameters to the
  experiment specified as arguments to the constructor with default values. The
  `spec` can be any key value pairs (and can include constant values which will
  remain common across all trials).

  Other types available can be seen in [param_types.py](./kondo/param_types.py).

* Generate trials and create a new experiment each time
  ```python
  for _, trial in hparams.trials():
    exp = MyExp(**trial)
    exp.run()
  ```

  A sample output for these three trials with randomly selected values for `foo`
  and `bar` is shown below. Each line represents the dictionary sent in to the
  constructor of the `MyExp` class.

  ```shell
  Running experiment with foo=93, bar="b".
  Running experiment with foo=30, bar="c".
  Running experiment with foo=75, bar="c".
  ...
  ```

* You can also generate trials from only a subset of groups by using the `groups` argument as
  ```python
  for _, trial in hparams.trials(groups=['fixed_foo']):
    # ... same as earlier
  ```
  `ignore_groups` is a similar argument with the filtering out effect.

Now, you can keep tuning the spec during your hyperparameter search and *throw
away the ones that don't spark joy*!.

The full example file is available at [basic.py](./examples/basic.py).

## Advanced Usage

See [Experiment](./kondo/experiment.py) object for other important attributes.
The only thing to care about are `@property` annotated methods, especially the
ones for logging.

The [tests](./kondo/tests) directory is a good place to discover all possibilities.
