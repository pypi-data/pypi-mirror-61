Description: # ARPA2 Shell for ACL Management
        
        > *The arpa2acl shell is a generic mechanism for setting up ACL information.
        > An ACL defines who is permitted to do what.*
        
        An ACL is a general instrument for management of rights by users or, more
        dynamically, role occupants.  In the ARPA2 project, we recognise two classes
        of rights:
        
          * Communication (with a certain peer)
          * Resource use
        
        More information on this is on the following pages:

        ## Using the ARPA2 Shell for ACL Management
        
        To start the shell, run the following command from an operating system
        command line or the ARPA2 meta-shell named `arpa2shell` with the
        command
        
        ```
        arpa2acl
        ```
        
        Use the `help` function to check the details.  This shell has not been
        fully finalised yet.
