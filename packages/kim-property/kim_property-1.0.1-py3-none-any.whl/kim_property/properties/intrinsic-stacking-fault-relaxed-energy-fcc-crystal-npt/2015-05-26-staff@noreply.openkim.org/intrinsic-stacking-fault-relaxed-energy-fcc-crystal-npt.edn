   "property-title" "Relaxed intrinsic stacking fault energy for a monoatomic fcc crystal at zero temperature and a given pressure"

   "property-description" "The intrinsic stacking fault (ISF) energy for a monoatomic fcc crystal at zero temperature and a specified pressure. The ISF corresponds to a fault of the form ABC|BCA. Relaxation of the atomic coordinates is performed in the direction perpendicular to the fault plane."
