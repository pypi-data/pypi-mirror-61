   "property-title" "Relaxed extrinsic stacking fault energy for a monoatomic fcc crystal at a zero temperature and a given pressure"

   "property-description" "The extrinsic stacking fault (ESF) energy for a monoatomic fcc crystal at zero temperature and a specified pressure. The ESF corresponds to an ABC|BA|BC stacking, which can also be understood as a two-layer twin nucleus. Relaxation of the atomic coordinates is performed in the direction perpendicular to the fault plane."
