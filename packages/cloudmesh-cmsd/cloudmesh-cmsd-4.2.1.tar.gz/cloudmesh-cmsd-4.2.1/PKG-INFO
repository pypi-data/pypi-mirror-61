Description: # Cloudmesh cmsd
        
        Cloudmesh cmsd is a command to run cloudmesh in a container regardles of
        the OS. Thus it is extreemly easy to install and use.
        
        cmsd will however use locally installed keys in `~/.ssh` and cloud
        configurations stored in `~/.cloudmesh/cloudmehs.yaml`. The yaml file
        will be created upon first call of cmsd if it is not available.
        
        ## How to use *cmsd*
        
        ### Prerequesites
        
        * Docker
        * python 3.8 or newer
        * We strongle recommended to use a python virtual environment
        * Install *cloudmesh-installer* by following the documentation in the [Cloudmesh manual](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/installation/install.html#installation-of-cloudmesh-source-install-for-developers)
        
        
        ### cmsd installation 
        
        - Activate the python virtual environment
        - Clone `cloundmesh-cmsd` repository to a directory of your preference (we reccommend `~\cm`)
        
        ```
          cloudmesh-installer git clone cmsd
        ```
        
        - Install cloudmesh-cmsd using cloudmesh-installer 
        
        ```
          cloudmesh-installer install cmsd
        ```
        
        - Check if the installation succeded
        
        ```
        cmsd --help
        ```
        
        ### cmsd initial setup 
        
        To run cmsd, you would need a configuration directory that is mounted into the containee
        Let us call this `CLOUDMESH_HOME_DIR`. The directory name must not have in a space in it. 
        
        Clarification for Windows users: For example `C:\.cloudmesh` will work, so does
        `C:\Users\gregor\.cloudmesh`, but not `C:\Users\gregor von Laszewski\.cloudmesh`
        
        Please also note that in docker setup you need to select the drive C for file access.
        
        Once you created the directory, you need to run the initial setup 
        
        ```  
        > cmsd --setup <CLOUDMESH_HOME_DIR>
        ```
        
        Next, run `cmsd --ps` to see if the `cloudmesh-cms-container` is running! 
        Additionally, check `CLOUDMESH_HOME_DIR` contains the `cloudmesh.yaml` file. 
        
        Now that the first phase of the setup succeded, let us set up mongodb with the cmsd container. You now need 
        to setup a password for the MongoDB. 
        
        ```
        > cmsd config set cloudmesh.data.mongo.MONGO_PASSWORD=<some password>
        ```
        
        Run `cmsd --setup <CLOUDMESH_HOME_DIR>` **again** to complete the process. 
        
        Check if both `cloudmesh-cms-container` and `cloudmesh-mongo-container` both are running, using `cmsd --ps`
        
        You can check the `cloudmesh.yaml` file content by running, 
        
        ```
        > cmsd config cat
        ```
        
        ### cmsd subsequent usages 
        
        - To stop the containers, use `cmsd --stop`. 
        - To start/restart the containers, use `cmsd --start`. 
        - To clean the containers (remove stopped containers), use `cmsd --clean`. 
        - To log into the running `cloudmesh-cms-container`, use `cmsd --shell`. 
        
        
        ### MongoDB and Mongo client connections  
        
        cmsd is running an official MongoDB container from Docker Hub. Refer [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) and the mongo server instance is bound to the `127.0.0.1:27071` port. Therefore you can use any Mongo client to explore the database by connecting to this port. 
        
        > NOTE:
        
        > Unix - 
        > At the setup, `CLOUDMESH_HOME_DIR/mongodb`  directory will be created and used as the data directory for mongo DB. We recommend that you ues `~/.cloudmesh` as `CLOUDMESH_HOME_DIR`. YOu can set it with 
        
        > ```
        > $ export CLOUDMESH_HOME_DIR=~/.cloudmesh
        > ```
        
        > Windows - 
        > Docker windows directory mounting does not work properly with mongo container. See [here](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/2189). Hence, a docker volume will be mounted as the data directory. YOu could set is to a directory in your `C:` drive that you create, but it must not have a space in its name.
        
        
        ### Example usecase - Creating a vm in AWS 
        
        - Create an AWS account and add the authentication information in the `CLOUDMESH_HOME_DIR/cloudmesh.yaml` file. Refer [Cloudmesh Manual - AWS](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/accounts/aws.html)
        
        - Set cloud to `aws`
        ```
          cmsd set cloud=aws 
        ```
        
        - Set AWS key name 
        ```
          cmsd set key=<key name> 
        ```
        
        - Boot a vm with the default config
        ```
          cmsd vm boot 
        ```
        
        ## End user deployment 
        
        Please uese a python virtualenv as to not interfere with your system python.
        Activate your python venv. Next just call
        
            pip install cloudmesh-cmsd
            
        This will install a command `cmsd` in your environment that you can use
        as in place replacement for the cms command.
        
        ## Developer Source install
        
        For developers it can be installed in an easy fashion with
        
            mkdir cm
            cd cm
            pip install cloudmesh-installer -U
            cloudmesh-installer git clone cmsd
            cloudmesh-installer git install cmsd
         
        Now you can use the command 
        
            cmsd help
        
        The source code is contained in

          This command passes the arguments to a docker container
          that runs cloudmesh.
        
          Arguments:
              COMMAND the commands we bass along
        
          Description:

                prints this manual page
        
            cmsd --image
        
                list the container
        
            cmsd --setup [CLOUDMESH_HOME_DIR]
        
                Sets up cmsd 
        
            cmsd --clean
        
                removes the container form docker
        
            cmsd --version
        
                prints out the verison of cmsd and the version of the container
        
            cmsd --update
        
                gets a new container form dockerhub
        
            cmsd COMMAND
        
                The command will be executed within the container, just as in
                case of cms.
        
            cmsd
        
                When no command is specified cms will be run in interactive
                mode.
