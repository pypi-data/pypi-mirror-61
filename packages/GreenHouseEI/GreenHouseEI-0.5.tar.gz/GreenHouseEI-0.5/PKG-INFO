        ## What we can do:
        
        We can do *italics* and **bold text**.
        
        * Lists
        * Are
        * Fun
        * Too
          * (But please use responsibly)
        
        Code blocks:
        ```
        >>> pypi_supports_markdown
        True
        ```
        
        And much much more!
