The dictionary entry must contain a `'wavelengths'` and a `'fluxes'` entry for each object. Both of these must be lists or numpy arrays. Astropy units can optionally be attached to each list. Currently Mirage supports only `F_lambda` (or equivalent) units, `F_nu` (or equivalent) units, or normalized units, which can be specified using astropy's `pct` unit. In the example below, note the use of `FLAMBDA_CGS_UNITS`, `FLAMBDA_MKS_UNITS`, and `FNU_CGS_UNITS`, which have been imported from Mirage. *Target_7* also uses a set of frequencies (note the specification of Hz for units), rather than wavelengths.
