Description: # Statistical tools for teaching at NBI 
        
        This package extends some of the existing tools in
        [_NumPy_](https://numpy.org) and [_SciPy_](https://scipy.org) with
        some useful features designed to make life easier for the students at
        the Niels Bohr Institute. 
        
        ## Topics
        
        - Reporting scientific results, including proper rounding 
        - Tabulation of data useful in Jupyter Notebooks 
        - Visualisation of data in 1 and many dimensions 
        - Robust calculations of sample means, variances, and covariances, for
          unweighted and weighted samples.  For weighted samples, both
          _frequency_ and _non_-frequency weights are supported. 
        - Histogramming 
        - Sampling of arbitrary PDFs 
        - Curve fitting using 
          - Linear least squares 
          - Non-linear least squares 
          - Maximum likelihood estimates 
        - Representation of fit confidence contours 
        
        ## Examples of use 
        
        [This
        notebook](https://cholmcc.gitlab.io/nbi-python/statistics/#nbi_stat_exa)
        gives examples of use. 
        
        ## Booklet on Statistics with Python 
        
        The booklet [Statistics Overview - With
        Python](https://cholmcc.gitlab.io/nbi-python/statistics/#Statistik)
        lays out much of the theoretical foundation for the tools available. 
        
        ## Application Programming Interface Documentation 
        
        The API is
        [documented](https://cholmcc.gitlab.io/nbi-python/statistics/nbi_stat).
