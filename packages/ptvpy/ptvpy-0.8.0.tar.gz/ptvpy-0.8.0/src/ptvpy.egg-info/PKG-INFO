        A free and open-source command line tool and Python library for
        `particle tracking velocimetry`_ enabling a flexible workflow with reproducible
        and reliable results.
        PtvPy depends on and extends functionality from the excellent library trackpy_ and
        provides a periphery to visualize, analyze and export the data involved.
        
        It is developed at the `Chair of Measurement & Sensor System Technique`_ at the TU
        Dresden to facilitate data analysis.
        It was eventually published in 2019 as free and open-source software.
