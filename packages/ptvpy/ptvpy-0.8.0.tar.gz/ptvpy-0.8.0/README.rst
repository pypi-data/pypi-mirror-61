A free and open-source command line tool and Python library for
`particle tracking velocimetry`_ enabling a flexible workflow with reproducible
and reliable results.
PtvPy depends on and extends functionality from the excellent library trackpy_ and
provides a periphery to visualize, analyze and export the data involved.

It is developed at the `Chair of Measurement & Sensor System Technique`_ at the TU
Dresden to facilitate data analysis.
It was eventually published in 2019 as free and open-source software.
