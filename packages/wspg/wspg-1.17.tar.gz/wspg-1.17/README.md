Messages sent by the client
===========================

Messages sent by the client must be JSON-encoded objects with at least the
"type" and "id" keys, both of which must have string values.

The "type" identifies the type of request, whilst the "id" is echoed back in
replies sent by the server.

The request messages are detailed below.


select
------
```json
{
    "type": "select",
    "id": "opaque string",
    "schema": "wspg",

    "relation": "demonstration_table",
    "function": {
        "name": "demonstration_function",
        "arguments": ["abc", 123]
    },
    "query-rules": {...},
    "returning-columns": ["id", "name", "address"],
    "result-format": "json",
    "order": [
        {"column": "name"},
        {"column": "age", "direction": "descending"}
    ],

    {"id": 15, "name": "Radia Perlman"},
    {"id": 16, "name": "Carl Sassenrath"}
]
```
(or null if "returning-columns" was an empty list)

]
```
(or null if "returning-columns" was an empty list)


listen
------
```json
{
    "type": "listen",
    "id": "opaque string",
    "channel": "task_list_updated"
}
```

If successful, the result object will be null.


unlisten
------
```json
{
    "type": "unlisten",
    "id": "opaque string",
    "channel": "task_list_updated"
}
```

If successful, the result object will be null.

}
```

 * token is optional - the default value is null.

A null token will clear any existing claims set for the issuer.

If successful, the result object will be the number of seconds the new token
is considered valid for (or null in the case of a null token), and any
existing claims set for the issuer will have been replaced.

If unsuccessful, any existing claims set for the issuer is left unchanged.


get-canonical-representations
-----------------------------
```json
{
    "type": "get-canonical-representations",
    "id": "opaque string",
    "types": ["bigint", "inet", "integer", "macaddr", "text"],
    "value": "112233445566"
}
```

If successful, the result object will be:
```json
{
    "bigint": 112233445566,
    "macaddr": "11:22:33:44:55:66",
    "text": "112233445566"
}
```


Messages sent by the server
===========================

Messages sent by the server are JSON-encoded objects with a "type" key having a
string value.

The server messages are detailed below:


failed
------
```json
{
    "type": "failed",
    "id": "opaque string",
    "reason": "Human-readable text",

    "detail": {
        "postgresql": {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

This indicates that the server was unable to successfully process the request.
The "detail" object is not always included.


succeeded
---------
```json
{
    "type": "succeeded",
    "id": "opaque string",
    "result": ...
}
```

This indicates that the server successfully processed the request.  The "result"
object is specific to the type of request and is described in the previous
section.


database-readiness
------------------
```json
{
    "type": "database-readiness",
    "ready": true
}
```

This indicates whether the server believes the backend database is ready.

This is sent immediately after the client connects and whenever the readiness
state changes.


issuer-claims-expired
---------------------
```json
{
    "type": "issuer-claims-expired",
    "issuer": "weblogin"
}
```

This indicates that the claims set for the issuer have been cleared because the
expiry time has been reached.


notification
------------
```json
{
    "type": "notification",
    "channel": "task_list_updated",
    "payload": "Row 123 changed"
}
```


Note about concurrency
======================

Multiple requests made by the client are processed concurrently by the server,
so it is possible for results to arrive out of order - use the "id" key to
relate results to their request.


Note about database readiness
=============================

When a backend database becomes unavailable, the client will receive a
"database-readiness" message with "ready" set to false.  Once the server
has resynchronised with the backend database, the client will receive a
"database-readiness" message with "ready" set to true.  The server will have
resubscribed to channels as requested by the client before sending
"ready": true, however some notifications may be missed whilst the server
was reconnecting to the backend database.


Note about query-rules
======================

"query-rules" is a [jQuery QueryBuilder](http://querybuilder.js.org/) ruleset.

A simple example object is:
```json
{
    "condition": "AND",
    "rules": [
        {
            "field": "address",
            "operator": "string_like",
            "value": "%Street"
        },
        {
            "condition": "OR",
            "rules": [
                {
                    "field": "name",
                    "operator": "string_case_insensitive_equal_to",
                    "value": "ALAN turing"
                },
                {
                    "field": "id",
                    "operator": "greater_than_or_equal_to",
                    "value": "12"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

For details of the available operators, see the `wspg.query_rules_rule_set_parser.QueryRulesRuleSetParser` class.


Note about sliced select
========================

By default records are returned starting at the beginning of the result-set
until "limit" records have been found.  "slice" allows the beginning of the
result-set to be positioned relative to previously received results.

"relative-to" is the (optional) previously received row data from which to
calculate the result-set ("relative-to" is not included in the result-set).  If
"relative-to" is not specified, the results start from an imaginary row that is
before the first row of results.

"direction" is the (optional) direction in which to move over the result-set
- "later" is the normal ordering, seeking forward from "relative-to",
with "earlier" the opposite.  Rows are returned in order of increasing
distance from "relative-to".

Within a set of related sliced selects the "query-rules" and "order"
select attributes should be identical.  An absolute, unique ordering is
required for consistency of the result set - the caller should ensure a unique
column is included in "order" ("order" is required when "slice" is specified).


Note about require-updatable
============================

"require-updatable" is intended to provide clients with a hint as to the
potential for a future UPDATE or DELETE to succeed.

When "require-updatable" is true, the '[...] FOR SHARE' locking clause is
added to the underlying 'SELECT', which causes both 'SELECT' and 'UPDATE'
row-level security policies to filter the relation.  The row-level locks
for which 'FOR SHARE' is really designed will be immediately released and so
offer no additional guarantee.

A PostgreSQL permissions error will be generated if the database user has not
been granted the UPDATE permission on the relation.


Note about result-format
========================

"result-format" accepts "json" or "csv", and defaults to "json".
