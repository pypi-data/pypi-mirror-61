### Getting Started
Please Install DeepFit package using 
```
!pip install deepfitv
```

### Programming Guide

**Incision Object Declaration**
```
deepfitv.incision.Incision(<path of image>)
```

To identify incision image object detection run the object detection function run 
```
deepfitv.incision.Incision(<path of image>).object_detection()
```

To classify the incisin image into less than 30 or post 30 days of surgery run 
```
deepfitv.incision.Incision(<path of image>).classify_image()
```

#### Prerequisites

deepfitv.incision module requires 'imageai' and 'tensorflow' libraries as dependencies
```
!pip install tensorflow
!pip install imageai
```

To run the Incision Object Image use case one would need to download the model h5 files which we have developed and copy in the
directory 
```
Incision/models
```
