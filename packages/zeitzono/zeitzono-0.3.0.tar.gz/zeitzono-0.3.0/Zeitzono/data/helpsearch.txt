SEARCHING
---------

The purpose of Zeitzono's city search is to find cities as quickly as
possible.

Search: TERM1 [TERM2 [ADMIN]]

Entering a search term will search cities that match TERM1.

Entering two search terms will search cities for match TERM1 AND TERM2

Entering three search terms will search cities for match TERM1 AND TERM2
and that have an adminsitrative area (country name or admin1/admin2
field) that match ADMIN.

EXAMPLES
--------

A search for "peter" will match a number of cities that contain that
name including St Petersburg in Russia and the United States.

A search for "peter boro" will match two cities named Peterborough in
the UK and Canada.

A search for "peter boro can" will match the Canadian city by that name.

Search for city name will match against the city name as well as an
alternative names list. So a search for "Bombay" will match "Mumbai".

A search for "apple" will bring up New York City as a result, because
"The Big Apple" is an alternate name for NYC.


SELECTING A CITY
----------------

Search results are ordered such that the city with the largest
population will be at the bottom.

Hitting Enter will select the city at the bottom of the search results.

If the search results return multiple cities, selecting 0-9 will select
that particular city, where 0 selects the bottom city, and 1 selects the
city above it, etc.

Hitting Escape at any time will cancel the city search and return you to
the main window.
