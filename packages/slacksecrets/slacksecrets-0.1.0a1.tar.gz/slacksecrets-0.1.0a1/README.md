`SlackSecrets` is a tool to discover sensitive information in Slack instances (access tokens, API keys, password hashes, etc.). It offers several modes,

1. **Live monitoring** - Leverages the Real-Time Messaging API to scan messages as they're sent.
1. **Historical** - Scans every message since the creation of the Slack workspace. This can be done with the web API or with Slack's "Export Data" feature.

## Getting Started

`pip install slacksecrets`

`SlackSecrets` will need a valid Slack API token. `SlackSecrets` will take a token from the command line with the `--token <slack-token>` option, or if a `SLACK_TOKEN` environment variable is set. The `--token` parameter will override the `SLACK_TOKEN` environment variable.

### Historical Slack scanning (using Slack "Export Data")

1. Ensure you're logged into Slack's web management interface and browse to "Import/Export Data" (https://<workspace-name>.slack.com/services/export)
1. Choose a data range (or entire history) and click "Start Export"
1. When the export is ready, download the .zip file from the "Past Exports" section on the page. The filename is usually `<workspace-name> Slack export <start-date> - <end-date>.zip`.
1. Extract the file to a directory on your local machine.
1. Run `SlackSecrets` with the `exported` command, and specify the extracted directory, like so: `slacksecrets exported --export-dir <path-to-extracted-directory>`.

## Contributing

The easiest way to start contributing is to add a YARA rule.

### YARA Rule Template

To ensure consistency and testability, the following template for YARA rules should be used. The meta `author`, `date`, and `description` fields should be added for each rule. If there is a link to a blog post or another resource that provides context to the rule definition, that should be included in the `reference` tag.

Test cases should be in the `test_match_` and `test_no_match_` meta fields. These fields will be automatically tested as part of the build process.

```yaml
rule NameOfRule : TagsGoHere
{
    meta:
        name = ""
        author = ""
        date = "YYYY-MM-DD"
        reference = "https://..." /* if needed */

        /* Test Cases */
        test_match_1 = ""
        test_match_2 = ""
        test_no_match_1 = ""
        test_no_match_2 = ""

    strings:

    condition:
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why YARA over regular expressions?

YARA natively [supports regular expressions](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writingrules.html#regular-expressions), as well as many other useful features, such as [external variables](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writingrules.html#external-variables), [file size](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writingrules.html#file-size), and importantly, [metadata tags](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writingrules.html#metadata) which are used to define test-cases within the rule file. This aims to solve an issue with existing tools that rely on regular expressions - that is, either no test cases are defined (requiring users to trust the regex is correct), or that test cases are split from the regex definition. Using the metadata tags allows the YARA rules to be included in other tools without the test-cases interfering.

### Why does `SlackSecrets` use a sqlite database?

The Slack API is rate-limited and for large Slack instances, the number of messages posted may be in the tens of millions. The [`conversation.history` API call](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.history) is ["Tier 3"](https://api.slack.com/docs/rate-limits#tier_t3) which allows 50 requests per minute. The maximum number of messages returned in a given `conversation.history` request is 1000 (or 50,000 a minute or 3,000,000 an hour). `SlackSecret` uses the local sqlite database to track scanning progress in channels (so as not to repeat scanning the same messages if the scan is interrupted), uploaded files, and of course, discovered secrets.
