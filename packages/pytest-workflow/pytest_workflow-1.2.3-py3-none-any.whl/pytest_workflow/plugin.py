    # user interface. But this is not fine for the plugin implementation. If
    # `-m` is used we need to evaluate the mark expression and make sure it
    # applies to the marks of the workflow. This requires reusing of the pytest
    # code, which is a hell to implement.
    # Additionally, markers can not have whitespace. So using the name of a
    # workflow as a default tag is not possible. Unless you first replace
    # whitespace for both command line and the test_.yml to make sure the marks
    # are correct. This is non-trivial. Alternatively, the schema could not
    # allow whitespace in names. That is just being plain annoying to the user
    # for no good reason. Maybe the user does not want to use tags, and then it
    # is extra hassle for a feature that is not even used.
