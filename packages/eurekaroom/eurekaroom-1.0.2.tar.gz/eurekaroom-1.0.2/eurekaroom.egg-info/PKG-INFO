Description: # SpaceRoom
        
        By [CDEguia](https://cdeguia.me) with [YetiCraft](https://www.yeticraft.net), and [J. Scott](https://gitlab.com/jscott) for [Eureka Room](http://www.theeurekaroombham.com/)
        
        Code for running escape room hardware comprised of Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's running Rasbian.
        
        ## General Setup
        
        The following section describes the setup process in generic detail.
        
        1. First, create an SD card with the Raspbian OS (latest) image using the methods found [online](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).
        2. Write ssh and wifi configs to the /boot partition so that both will be available upon first boot (with or without a screen attached)
           1. [Enable SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md#3-enable-ssh-on-a-headless-raspberry-pi-add-file-to-sd-card-on-another-machine)
        3. Insert the prepared card and boot the device.
        4. Connect to the device.
        
        ## Production
        
        For production purposes, each Eurekaroom node will run on a Raspberry Pi (version 3b or higher) with Raspbian (latest) as the OS.
        
        ### Install Eurekaroom
        
            $ pip3 install eurekaroom
        
        ### Usage
        
        To use the command line utility, execute the following on the linux system in a terminal where you have installed the package:
        
        Display Help:
        
            $ ecmd -h
        
        Run Web interface using default config:
        
            $ ecmd -as
        
        Launch Web interface with user provided config and save provide config:
        
            $ ecmd -wam PATH_TO_MEDIA -n NODE_NAME -s
        
        Change the default node name:
        
            $ ecmd --writeconfig --nodename NODE_NAME
        
        Change the default media path:
        
            $ ecmd --writeconfig --mediapath PATH_TO_MEDIA
        
        Add media to the config file:
        
            $ ecmd --writeconfig --autoaddmedia
        
        Launch the web interface:
        
            $ ecmd -s
        
        > This will allow you to control the media displayed on the node through the web interface.
        
        To access you ecmd web interface open up your favorite web browser on any pc connected to the same network as your node and enter the ip address followed by the port number i.e. "192.168.0.54:5000/"
        
        #### Auto start on boot
        
        If eurekaroom was installed with the `pip install eurekaroom` command you can run:
        
            $ ecmd --installservice
        
        > Or set the autostart application in the auto-login account to be the `/full/path/to/ecmd -s` command.
        
        Reboot and ensure the system is responding on the expected when port and to command line execution.
        
        ## Development
        
        ### Clone Repo
        
        Clone this repo or copy the code to the target linux system.  To clone the repo to a Linux system, ensure that you have `git` installed properly and then use the following command from a terminal:
        
            $ git clone git@gitlab.com:growlf/eurekaroom.git
        
        > This will expect that your SSH keys are installed on this system in the correct path.  
        
        ### Add system dependencies
        
        Next, open a terminal shell and execute the following, which will update packages and install the system dependencies:
        
            $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install -y git python3-pip python3-tk libjpeg-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev zlib1g-dev libopenjp2-7-dev libdbus-1-dev libtiff5
            $ pip3 install --user pipenv
            $ export PATH=$PATH:/home/pi/.local/bin # Add new path
            $ exit # Reboot the Pi
        
        ### Activate development ecmd
        
        Next, open a terminal shell within the code directory to execute the following commands:
        
            $ pipenv shell
            $ pip install -e .
        
        This will create and activate a local Python3 virtual environment that allows isolation from the system's copy of Python and it's libraries. This Python environment will be completely dedicated to this project and will not affect the system Python interpreter - nor be affected by it.
        
        ### Development Media
        
        Next, add your media files (Images and Videos folders) into system.  It is recommended to use a layout similar to the following for default configuration:
        
            eurekaroom (project root, created from the git clone operation)
            |
            +-/bin
            | +-/ecmd (commandline tool)
            |
            +-/eurekaroom (module folder)
            | | ...(class definition files)  
            |
            +-/Media
            | | ... (misc media - should be none)
            | +-/Images
            | | ... (image files)
            | +-/Videos
            |   ... (video files)
            |
            +-/tests (test folder)
            | | ...(test files)  
            |
            +-/eurekanode.log
            +-/README.md
            +-/requirements.txt
            +-/Pipfile
            +-/Pipfile.lock
            +-/setup.py
