        * irelease is Python package that will help to release your python package on both github and pypi.
        A new release of your package is created by taking the following steps:
            1. Extract the version from the __init__.py file
            2. Remove old build directories such as dist, build and x.egg-info
            3. Git pull (to make sure all is up to date)
            4. Get latest release version at github
            5. Check if the local (current) version is newer then the latest github release.
                a. Make new wheel, build and install package
                b. Set tag to newest version
                c. Push to git
                d. Upload to pypi (credentials for pypi required)

        * It is distributed under the MIT license.
        
        ### Quick Start
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements
        pip install irelease
        ```
        ### Alternatively, install irelease from the GitHub source:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/erdogant/irelease.git
        cd irelease
        python setup.py install
        ```
        ### Arguments or irelease
        Go to the directory where the package is you want to release and run irelease by: 
        ```bash
        $ python irelease.py
        ```
        
        The following arguments are availble:
        ```bash
        # Github name
        irelease -u <githubname>
        
        # Package name your want to release
        irelease -p <packagename>
        
        # Removing local builds:
        # 1: Yes
        # 0: No
        irelease -c 1
        
        # Verbosity messages:
        # 0: No messages
        # 1: Error only
        # 2: Warnings and above
        # 3: Regular messages and above
        # 4: Debug and above
        # 5: Trace and above
        irelease -v 5
        
        # Twine path for to irelease at pypi. This is automatically determined if standard installation is performed.
        irelease -t 'C://Users/erdogant/AppData/Roaming/Python/Python36/Scripts/twine.exe'
        ```
        
        ### Example:
        Your package to-be-published must have the correct structure. At least these files and folders are expected:
        ```bash
            <any_dirname>/
            â”œâ”€â”€ <package_dir>/
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package_name.py
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
            â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
            â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
            â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
            â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
            â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py
            â””â”€â”€ ...
        ```
        
        * To release your package, to most easy way is to generate a release bash file using irlease.
        ```python
        # 1. Go into your package directory
        # 2. start ptyhon
        # 3. Import irelease, run irelease.get_script()
        # 4. A new file (release.sh) is created in your package directory.
        # 5. Run it.
        
        # $ python
        import irelease
        irelease.get_script()
        exit()
        ```
        ```bash
        $ release.sh
        ```
        
        ### Example: releasing bnlearn package.
        ```bash
            bnlearn/
            â”œâ”€â”€ bnlearn/
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bnlearn.py
            â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
            â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
            â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
            â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
            â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py
        ```

        </p>
        
        * Option 1: Create release bash file and run. 
        ```bash
        $ python
        >>> import irelease
        >>> irelease.get_script()
        $ release.sh
        ```
        
        * Option 2: Run python file. 
        ```bash
        $ bnlearn>python C:\Users\Erdogan\Miniconda3\envs\env_TEST\Lib\site-packages\irelease\irelease.py
        ```
        
        ```bash
        # Package can be specified:
        $ \bnlearn>python irelease -p bnlearn
        
        # Username can be specified:
        $ bnlearn>python irelease.py -u erdogant
        
        # Cleaning of previous builds in directory can be disabled
        $ bnlearn>python irelease.py -c 0
        ```

        </p>
        
        You need to do one final edit on github:
