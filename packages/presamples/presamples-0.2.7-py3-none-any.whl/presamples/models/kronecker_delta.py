    """A model that choose only one input from multiple possibilities at each iteration. All other possible inputs are set to zero. See `Kronecker delta functions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta>`__.

    See documentation on ``InventoryBaseModel`` for how to specify ``exchanges``.

    If ``normalize`` is true, then the amount of the selected input is set to one (or minus one if negative). Otherwise, it is set the the original ``amount`` value.

    If ``equal_choice`` is true, then an input is selected with equal probability among all possible inputs. If false, then the absolute values of the amounts are used as weights.

    ``iterations`` is the number of Monte Carlo iterations to generate.

    Selection is made by choosing a random index between zero and ``len(exchanges)``. The value of this selector variable is stored in ``self.selector``.

    Currently, this class doesn't ensure that all inputs come from the same activity, or that the provided exchanges have any special type.
