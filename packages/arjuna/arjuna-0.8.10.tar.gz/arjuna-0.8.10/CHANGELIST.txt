Following is the list of critical additions and updates for a given released version:

0.8.10

- Added non-coding documentation:
    - Project Structure
- CLI Changes
    - cm/im switches removed based on new test structure.
    - cf/if changed to ct/it (--consider-tests, --ignore-tests).
    - run-pickers changed to run-selected.
- Simplification of With
    - class_name, class_names, compound_class -> With.classes
    - css_selector -> selector
    - tag_name -> tag
    - link_text -> flink (Full text of link)
    - link_ptext -> link (Default match in Arjuna is Partial)

- Current working directory is changed to project directory before pytest is launched.
- pytest.ini now present inside arjuna deployment.
- conftest.py now resides inside tests directory.
- Basic proof of concept done w.r.t. creating session level fixtures outside of conftest. Will build on this in upcoming versions.
