Description: # Arjuna
        
        Arjuna is a Python based test automation framework developed by Rahul Verma (www.rahulverma.net). Rahul has implemented smaller variants of features in Arjuna across frameworks and organizations, or given advise around it. However Arjuna being a generic library has the most complete implementation of his ideas, away from project specific contexts and constraints.
        
        Arjuna also includes UniTEE, a test engine that espouses the principles of Test Encapsulation by Rahul, as envisioned in a research paper in 2010.  It combines pragmatism by including decisions which are taken outside of the test for performance reasons.
        
        You'd need Python 3.5+ to make use of Arjuna.
        
        Note: On Linux, the built-in Python3 build has issues with the Python's built-in enum module which is heavily used in Arjuna. One alternative is to install ActiveState Python on linux. Advanced users can go for installing a custom Python build.
        
        ### Arjuna Installation
