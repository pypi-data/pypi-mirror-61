Add concurent requests to `parfive`. This feature splits the download of
a single file into multiple parts if the server the file is being downloaded
from supports ranged requests. This should improve the performance of all
downloads under these circumstances, and also make parfive useful even if
downloading a single file. No changes are needed to use this feature, files
will be downloaded using 12 concurrent requests by default. To change the
number of concurrent requests you can pass ``max_splits`` to
`parfive.Downloader.enqueue_file`.
