Description: #  Spriteutils
        Spriteutils is small project to determine ***Sprites*** (specified by
        there **unique label mask** and **bounding box**) in the given
        ***Sprite Sheet***.
        
        A [**Sprite**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)>)
        is a small [**raster graphic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics)
        (a **bitmap**) that represents an object
        
        It is not uncommon for games to have tens to hundreds of sprites.
        Loading each of these as an individual image would consume a lot of
        **memory** and **processing power**. To help manage sprites and avoid using so
        many images, many games use
        [**Sprite Sheets**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crrFUYabm6E)
        
        This project is a tool to determine sprites (specified by there unique
        mask and bounding box) in the given Sprite Sheet.

        # Functional test
        Replicate the following step in python
        ```python
        # Import the package
        >>> from spriteutils import SpriteSheet
        # Specified the image file path name or create a PIL image
        >>> image = "path/to/your/image"
        # Create sprite sheet object
        >>> sprite_sheet = SpriteSheet(image)
        # Find all the sprites of the sprite sheet
        >>> sprites ,label_map = sprite_sheet.find_sprites()
        # Draw sprite masks for each sprite in the sprite sheet
        >>> image = sprite_sheet.create_sprite_labels_image()
        # Show the sprite masks image
        >>> image.show()
        ```
