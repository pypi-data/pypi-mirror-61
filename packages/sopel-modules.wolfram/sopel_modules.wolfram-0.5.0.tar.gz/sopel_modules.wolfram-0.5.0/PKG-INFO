Description: Sopel Wolfram\|Alpha plugin
        ===========================
        
        Wolfram\|Alpha plugin for Sopel IRC bot framework
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Sopel 7.x
        * wolframalpha 3.x
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package's full name is ``sopel-modules.wolfram`` and it is `listed on PyPI
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sopel-modules.wolfram>`_ under that identifier.
        
        The only supported installation method is via ``pip``::
        
            pip install sopel-modules.wolfram
        
        Use ``pip3`` as appropriate for your Python environment.
        
        Development versions can be installed from GitHub via ``pip`` also::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/dgw/sopel-wolfram.git@master
        
        Note that ``pip`` does not keep track of packages obtained from sources outside
        of PyPI, so ``pip install --upgrade sopel-modules.wolfram`` will not work for
        GitHub installations. Instead, to upgrade to the latest code, do::
        
            pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/dgw/sopel-wolfram.git@master
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Required
        ::::::::
        
        The Wolfram\|Alpha API requires a key to be added in the bot’s config. Click
        the "Get an AppID" button at https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps/
        and add your new AppID to Sopel’s configuration file:
        
        ::
        
            [wolfram]
            app_id = yourappidgoeshere
        
        Optional
        ::::::::
        
        * ``max_public``: the number of lines over which results will be sent in NOTICE
          instead of to the channel (default: 10)
        * ``units``: measurement system displayed in results, either ``metric`` (the
          default) or ``nonmetric``
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            <User> .wa 2+2
            <Sopel> [W|A] 2+2 = 4
        
            <User> .wa python language release date
            <Sopel> [W|A] Python | date introduced = 1991
        
            <User> .wa airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow
            <Sopel> [W|A] estimated average cruising airspeed of an unladen European
                    swallow = 25 mph  (miles per hour)(asked, but not answered, about a
                    general swallow in the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail)
        
        
        A Note About Reloading
        ----------------------
        
        Due to Python limitations, reloading a "packaged" Sopel plugin such as this
        one, might not actually reload all of the code. After updating sopel-wolfram,
        please restart the bot at your earliest convenience, rather than using Sopel's
        ``.reload`` function. The last tested version was: Sopel 7.0.0
        
        
        Support
        -------
        
        Help with installing or configuring the module is available by pinging either
        ``dgw`` or ``maxpowa`` in ``#sopel`` on freenode. ``dgw`` is also available in
        ``#Kaede`` on Rizon.
        
        Bugs and feature requests can be `submitted <https://github.com/dgw/sopel-wolfram/issues/new>`_
        to the GitHub issue tracker, preferably after first bringing them up on IRC.

          ``metric`` (default) or ``nonmetric`` measurements (#18; see #16)
