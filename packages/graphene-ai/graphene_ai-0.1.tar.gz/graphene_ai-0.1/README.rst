Build natural language AI into applications, bots, and services using
the Graphene API. Understand what your customers are saying, in whatever
language, in real-time.

Getting Started
===============

Usage
-----

::

    import graphene


    g = graphene.Graphene("<YOUR API KEY HERE>", 
    endpoint_url="https://graphene.indigoresearch.xyz/")

    print(g.request("entities","<UNIQUE SESSION ID HERE>", 
    "Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines"))

Understand language naturally
-----------------------------

Graphene uses natural language processing AI to extract knowledge from
text in a context-aware manner. Interpret the story behind the text, not
just the individual words, to be able to make the best decisions in your
application. Graphene instances can be customized to specific use cases
and are always learning and improving.

Multilanguage AI
----------------

You don't need to learn a whole language in order to understand it.
Graphene can process text whether it uses one language or a mix of
languages, and even work with legalese and medical jargon.

Context-aware Processing
------------------------

Words can sometimes mean different things depending on how they're used.
Filter through the noise and understand what your customers are trying
to tell you with the Graphene context-aware AI.

Bespoke Expertise
-----------------

Graphene comes as its own instance, and can be customized to understand
your business's vocabulary. It ships with a convenient interface to have
the AI learn your jargon; think of it as having your own domain-expert.
