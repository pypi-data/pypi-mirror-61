PyDERASN -- strict and fast ASN.1 DER/BER library for Python

    I'm going to build my own ASN.1 library with slots and blobs!
    (C) PyDERASN's author

* BER/CER/DER decoding, DER encoding
* Basic ASN.1 data types (X.208): BOOLEAN, INTEGER, BIT STRING, OCTET
  STRING, NULL, OBJECT IDENTIFIER, ENUMERATED, all strings, UTCTime,
  GeneralizedTime, CHOICE, ANY, SEQUENCE (OF), SET (OF)
* Size constraints checking
* Working with sequences as high level data objects with ability to
  (un)marshall them
* Python 2.7/3.5/3.6 compatibility
* Automatic decoding of DEFINED BY fields
* Ability to know exact decoded objects offset and lengths in the binary
* Pretty printer and command-line decoder, that could conveniently
  replace utilities like either dumpasn1 or openssl asn1parse
* __slots__, copy.copy(), pickle friendliness

pyderasn is free software: see the file COPYING.LESSER for copying conditions.
