Description: This Python package is created to remove outlier rows from a dataset.
        To use thi dataset you ned to create a pandas dataframe(you can use 
        pd.read_csv() to do it), and to to use this package your dataset
        should have only numerical values and if you have any strings
        then you can use one hot encoding or simple label encoder to do that,
        but make sure before using it that it is all done.
        Now this function takes one argument that is the dataframe.
        and your df variable will now contain the new data which
        will not contain outlier rows and this function will also
        print the number of rows deleted!
