Acknowledgments
==================

Thanks to everyone who has helped make this project a reality!

Open Source Contributions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've been lucky to have some financial support for PUDL over the last 3+
years, but a lot of the work has still been done on a volunteer basis, both
by members of Catalyst Cooperative and open source contributors, including:

* `Karl Dunkle Werner <https://karldw.org/>`__, a PhD student at UC Berkeley,
  who did a lot of the integration work for :ref:`data-epacems`.
* `Greg Schivley <https://gschivley.github.io/>`__, a recently minted PhD from
  Carnegie Mellon University, who has pointed us at lots of great open data
  resources, and integrated the :ref:`data-epaipm` data.
* `Priya Donti <https://priyadonti.com/>`__, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon
  University, for user experience and documentation feedback.
* `Josh Rhodes <https://sites.google.com/site/joshdr83/>`__,
  Brianna Cote, and `Vibrant Clean Energy <https://vibrantcleanenergy.com>`__
  for submitting Github issues and offering valuable user feedback.

Grant Funding
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The `Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Energy & Environment Program <https://sloan.org/programs/energy-and-environment>`__ has funded one year of concerted work on
PUDL aimed at serving the academic research community (May 2019 - April 2020).
Many thanks to Will Driscoll for providing feedback on and edits to our Sloan
proposal.

The PUDL project has also received support from
`The Flora Family Foundation <https://www.florafamily.org/>`__ to make the
processed data available in :doc:`datapackages`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Partnerships
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We wouldn't be here today without a long list of partners who have helped us
along the way.

We're thankful for the opportunity to participate as a pilot project in the
`Frictionless Data Reproducible Research <https://frictionlessdata.io/reproducible-research/>`__
program of the `Open Knowledge Foundation <https://okfn.org>`__. Open Knowledge
also supported Catalyst to attend `CSV,Conf,v4 <https://csvconf.com/2019>`__ in
Portland, Oregon.

Our initial 2017 work on PUDL was done as part of a project to enable
refinancing and early retirement of uneconomic coal plants, in collaboration
with `The Climate Policy Initiative Climate Finance Program <https://climatepolicyinitiative.org/climate-finance/>`__.
(See `these white papers <https://energyinnovation.org/publication/managing-the-utility-financial-transition-from-coal-to-clean-2>`__ for some of the results.)

The EU based
`Open Energy Modeling Initiative <https://openmod-initiative.org/>`__ and
`Open Power System Data <https://open-power-system-data.org/>`__ projects have
taught us a lot about how to wrangle this data for research purposes, and the
importance of the legal and licensing dimension of the work.

Thanks to Matt Wassen and Jeff Deal at
`Appalachian Voices <http://appvoices.org/>`__ for giving us a copy of their
archive of FERC Form 1 data that's no longer available online.

`Clean Energy Action <http://cleanenergyaction.org>`__ in
Boulder, Colorado gave several of us our first chance to get paid to do energy
policy and data analysis work, organizing around Xcel Energy's Colorado coal
plants.

The `Rocky Mountain Farmers Union <https://rmfu.org>`__ and their
`Cooperative Development Center <https://www.rmfu.org/what-we-do/cooperation/>`__
helped us incorporate as a worker cooperative in Colorado, and continue to
offer us affordable legal support.
