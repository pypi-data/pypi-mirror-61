    Test that we can correctly identify unmapped FERC Form 1 DB plants.

    This test replicates :func:`pudl.glue.ferc1_eia.get_unmapped_plants_ferc1`
    but deletes a plant from the raw FERC 1 DB contents, which should then be
    identified as "unmapped."

    Currently this test is XFAILing for several reasons:
      * Junk "Plants" with names like "0.0000"
      * Plants associated with previously "bad" respondents.
      * Plants with names containing special characters lke Ã±.

    These plants haven't been "mapped" to anything, at least in our current
    processes. The bad respondent and special character names should get
    integrated, but what do we do with the "junk" names?
