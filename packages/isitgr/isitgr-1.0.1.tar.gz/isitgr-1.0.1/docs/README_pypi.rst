Description
============


Integrated Software in Testing General Relativity (ISiTGR) 2019 version is a patch of CAMB software. 
CAMB can be downloaded in `CAMB project <https://pypi.org/project/camb/>`_ 
ISiTGR is intended to test deviations from GR at cosmological scales using cosmological datasets.
The code is in Python, with numerical code implemented in fast modern Fortran.

See the `ISiTGR python example notebook <https://isitgr.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ISiTGRdemo.html>`_ 
python notebook for illustrative examples of ISiTGR features.

To install the ISiTGR python package on your computer run:

    pip install isitgr [--user]

The --user is optional and only required if you don't have write permission to your main python installation.
You will need the usual dependencies as needed for the CAMB software.

The python wrapper provides a module called "isitgr" documented in `Python ISiTGR-CAMB documentation <https://isitgr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
