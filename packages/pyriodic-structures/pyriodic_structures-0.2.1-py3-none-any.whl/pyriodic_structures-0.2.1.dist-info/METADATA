## Introduction

`pyriodic` is an in-development library for compiling a database of
three-dimensional structures. It also supports several simple
manipulations of structures.

## Installation

Install `pyriodic` from source on github:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/klarh/pyriodic.git#egg=pyriodic-structures
```

By default, pyriodic only ships with a few very simple structures;
other libraries can be added by installing other packages, such as
[pyriodic-aflow](https://github.com/klarh/pyriodic-aflow), which
contains structures from the [AFLOW](http://aflowlib.org/) project.
