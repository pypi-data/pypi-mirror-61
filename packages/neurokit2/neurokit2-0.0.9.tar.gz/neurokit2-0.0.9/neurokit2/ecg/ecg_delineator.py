def ecg_delineator(ecg_cleaned, rpeaks, sampling_rate=500):
    """Delineate QRS complex.
    Function to delineate the QRS complex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ecg_cleaned : list, array or Series
        The cleaned ECG channel as returned by `ecg_clean()`.
    rpeaks : list, array or Series
        The samples at which R-peaks occur. Accessible with the key "ECG_R_Peaks" in the info dictionary returned by `ecg_findpeaks()`.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of `ecg_signal` (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
        Defaults to 500.

    Returns
    -------
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing additional information, in this case the
        samples at which P-peaks and T-peaks occur, accessible with the key "ECG_P_Peaks" and "ECG_R_Peaks" respectively.
