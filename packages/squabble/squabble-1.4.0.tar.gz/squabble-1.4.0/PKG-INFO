        Catch unsafe SQL migrations.
        
        .. code:: console
        
          $ squabble sql/migration.sql
          sql/migration.sql:4:46 ERROR: column "uh_oh" has a disallowed constraint [1004]
          ALTER TABLE big_table ADD COLUMN uh_oh integer DEFAULT 0;
                                                         ^
          # Use --explain to get more information on a lint violation
          $ squabble --explain 1004
          ConstraintNotAllowed
               When adding a column to an existing table, certain constraints can have
               unintentional side effects, like locking the table or introducing
               performance issues.
               ...
        
        Squabble can also be `integrated with your editor
        <https://squabble.rtfd.io/en/latest/editors.html>`__ to catch errors in
        SQL files.
        
        .. code:: console
        
          $ echo 'SELECT * FROM WHERE x = y;' | squabble --reporter=plain
          stdin:1:15 CRITICAL: syntax error at or near "WHERE"
        
        Currently, most of the rules have been focused on Postgres and its
        quirks. However, squabble can parse any ANSI SQL and new rules that are
        specific to other databases are appreciated!
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ pip3 install squabble
           $ squabble --help
        
        .. note::
        
           Squabble is only supported on Python 3.5+
        
        If you’d like to install from source:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ git clone https://github.com/erik/squabble.git && cd squabble
           $ python3 -m venv ve && source ve/bin/activate
           $ python setup.py install
           $ squabble --help
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        To see a list of rules, try
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ squabble --list-rules
        
        Then, to show more verbose information about a rule (such as rationale
        and configuration options)
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ squabble --show-rule AddColumnsDisallowConstraints
        
        Once a configuration file is in place, it can be passed explicitly on
        the command line, or automatically looked up.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ squabble -c path/to/config ...
        
        If not explicitly given on the command line, squabble will look for a
        file named ``.squabblerc`` in the following places (in order):
        
        -  ``./.squabblerc``
        -  ``(git_repo_root)/.squabblerc``
        -  ``~/.squabblerc``
        
        Per-File Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Configuration can also be applied at the file level by using SQL line comments
        in the form ``-- squabble-enable:RuleName`` or ``-- squabble-disable:RuleName``.
        
        For example, to disable ``RuleA`` and enable ``RuleB`` just for one file,
        this could be done:
        
        .. code-block:: sql
        
           -- squabble-disable:RuleA
           -- squabble-enable:RuleB config=value array=1,2,3
           SELECT email FROM users WHERE ...;
        
        To prevent squabble from running on a file, use ``-- squabble-disable``. Note
        that this will also disable syntax checking. Note that this flag will take
        precedence over any other configuration set either on the command line or in
        the rest of the file.
        
        
        Example Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code-block:: json
        
           {
             "reporter": "color",
        
             "plugins": [
               "/some/directory/with/custom/rules"
             ],
        
             "rules": {
               "AddColumnsDisallowConstraints": {
                 "disallowed": ["DEFAULT", "FOREIGN", "NOT NULL"]
               }
             }
           }
        
        Prior Art
        ---------
        
        ``squabble`` is of course not the first tool in this space. If it
        doesn't fit your needs, consider one of these tools:
        
        - `sqlcheck <https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck>`__ - regular
          expression based (rather than parsing), focuses more on ``SELECT``
          statements than migrations.
        - `sqlint <https://github.com/purcell/sqlint>`__ - checks that the
          syntax of a file is valid. Uses the same parsing library as
          squabble.
        - `sqlfluff <https://github.com/alanmcruickshank/sqlfluff>`__ -
          focused more on style and formatting, seems to still be a work in
          progress.

        This project would not be possible without:
        
        -  `libpg_query <https://github.com/lfittl/libpg_query>`__ - Postgres
           query parser
        -  `pglast <https://github.com/lelit/pglast>`__ - Python bindings to
           libpg_query
        -  Postgres - …obviously
