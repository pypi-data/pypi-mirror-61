General Installation
--------------------

Install the rpm as normal.


Installation procedure at CERN
-------------------------------

1. Build the RPM.
   - Usually you do this on the panda testbed machine. The
     main issue here is to make sure you use the same version 
     of python as the panda server.
   - You should be able to build with your normal AFS account,
     but you do need to copy the code locally (linking issues).

2. Install the RPM on the panda testbed machine (currently voatlas220).
   - Done as root ('sudo -s').

3. Check it works.
   - Check the schedconfig and pilot tarballs are fresh and contain the
     correct files.

4. Tag the release in SVN.
   *** N.B. Remember to update the release version number in setup.py. ***

5. Build the new release from the tag.

6. Take the new release RPM and put it somewhere public (e.g., afs)

7. Enter a savannah support ticket with the ATLAS central operations team to
   update to the new RPM on the panda servers.
 
   https://savannah.cern.ch/projects/atlascsops/
   
   An example:
   
   https://savannah.cern.ch/support/index.php?114740
   
   N.B. Membership of this savannah project is restricted. If you can't see
   it then ask a responsible to put in another support ticket asking for
   access.
   
8. Once Central Ops do the update *please check it*.
