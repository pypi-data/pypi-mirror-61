+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  to prevent loops using /WVT.

  to implement the nice modification to the algorithm proposed by
  Diehl & Statler (2006). 

V2.4.8: MC, Leiden, 23 December 2005
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Use geometric centroid of a bin during the bin-accretion stage,
  to allow the routine to deal with negative signal (e.g. in
  background-subtracted X-ray images). Thanks to Steven Diehl for
  pointing out the usefulness of dealing with negative signal.
      
V2.4.7: MC, Leiden, 27 September 2005
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  the algorithm. 

V2.4.5: MC, Leiden, 3 December 2004
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  naming conflicts. 

V2.4.4: MC, Leiden, 30 November 2004

  and noise=sqrt(signal)=0, as can happen from X-ray data.
      
V2.4.3: MC, Leiden, 29 November 2004
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Corrected bug introduced in version 2.3.1. It went undetected
  for a long time because it could only happen in special conditions.
  Now we recompute the index of the good bins after computing all
  centroids of the reassigned bins in reassign_bad_bins. Many thanks
  to Simona Ghizzardi for her clear analysis of the problem and
  the solution. 

V2.4.2: MC, Leiden, 4 August 2004
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Use LONARR instead of INTARR to define the CLASS vector,
  to be able to deal with big images. Thanks to Tom Statler.
      
V2.4.1: MC, Leiden, 14 December 2003
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Added /QUIET keyword and verbose output during the computation.
  After suggestion by Richard McDermid. 

V2.4.0: MC, Leiden, 10 December 2003
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Addedd basic error checking of input S/N. 
- Reintroduced the treatment for zero-size bins in CVT, which 
  was deleted in V2.2. Thanks to Robert Sharp and Kambiz Fathi 
  for reporting problems.

V2.3.1: MC, Leiden, 13 April 2003
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Do *not* assume the first bin is made of one single pixel.
- Added computation of S/N scatter and plotting of 1-pixel bins.
      
V2.3.0: MC, Leiden, 9 April 2003
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Unified the three tests to stop the accretion of one bin.
  This can improve some bins at the border. 

V2.2.0: MC, Leiden, 11 March 2003
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Added computation of useful bin quantities in output. Deleted some
  safety checks for zero size bins in CVT. Minor polishing of the code.
      
V2.1.0: MC, Vicenza, 13 February 2003
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- First released version. Written documentation.
