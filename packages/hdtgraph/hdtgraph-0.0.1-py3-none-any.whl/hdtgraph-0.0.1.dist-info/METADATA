# HDT poly-logarithmic fully-dynamic connectivity algorithm

Implementation of the dynamic graph data structure described by Holm,
de Lichtenberg and Thorup in 2001 (HDT algorithm).

The graph is represented as an ensemble of spanning forests where each spanning
tree is stored as a balanced binary Euler tour tree. This enables connectivity
queries in O(log n) as well as insertions and deletions in poly-logarithmic
time.
