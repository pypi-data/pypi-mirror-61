Description: # easySocket
        **Version 1.0.0**
        
        "easySocket" is a module for Python that's based on the "socket" module and aims to make tasks like sending long texts or files easier/simpler.
        
        I wrote this module, because I wanted to send an image with the socket module and found it annoying to always spend multiple lines of code to be able to send an image that was bigger than the maximum amount of bytes sendable with one socket.send command.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```shell
        pip install easySocket
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Host a tcp connection with one function:
        
        ```
        host_tcp(my_ip, port)
        ```
        
        Connect to a tcp conenction with one function:	
        
        ```
        connect_tcp(ip, port)
        ```
        
        Send a file over a tcp connection independent of size:
        
        ```python
        send_file(location, recipient)
        ```
        
        Send a text over a tcp connection independent of size:		
        
        ```
        send_text(text, recipient)
        ```
        
        Receive data from one of the two functions above:
        
        ```
        rcv_data(sender)
        ```
