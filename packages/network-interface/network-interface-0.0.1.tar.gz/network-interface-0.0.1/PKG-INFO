Description: 
        
        # network-interface
        In order to install, open the command prompt and type:
        ```
        pip install network-interface
        ```
        
        In this module you will find NetworkInterface class which is an abstract class to standardize the way of creating a network graph in networkx.
        
        Once you install this library, you have to install igraph library where:
        - Refer to [igraph/python](https://igraph.org/python/ ) if you are a linux or mac user
        - Refer to [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34113151/how-to-install-igraph-for-python-on-windows) if you are a windows user
        
        In order to use the class, you have to inherit this class and define the following abstract methods according to your dataset:
        - get_nodes
        - get_edges
        
        This class also has some helpful methods like (use help function to get more info about them):
        - get_nodes_list
        - get_edges_list
        - create_network_graph
        - nodes_df_to_nodes_list
        - calculate_nodes_positions(using the most common algorithms to calculate nodes positions in a network graph)
        - append_nodes_positions_to_nodes_attributes
        - get_nodes_pos_dict
        
        The following directory [to be added later]() shows a concrete example about how to use the class
