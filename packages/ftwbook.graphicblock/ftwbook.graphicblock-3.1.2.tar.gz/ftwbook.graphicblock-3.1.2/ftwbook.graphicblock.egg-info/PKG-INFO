        ====================
        
        
        This package is a addon for the `ftw.book`_ package. It provides an
        additional simplelayout-based block for uploading PDF documents, which
        will then be included in the book PDF.
        
        The block is intended to be used for including vector based data such
        as charts. The uploaded PDF is included in the exported PDF of the whole
        book directly as PDF, so that there is no quality loss.
