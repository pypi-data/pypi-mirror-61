"""This module provides access to the **spectroscopic** data release of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey conducted between 2005
and 2007. Light curves are presented for 10,258 variable and transient sources
discovered through repeat ugriz imaging of SDSS Stripe 82, a 300 deg2 area
along the celestial equator. This data release is comprised of all transient
sources brighter than r â‰ƒ 22.5 mag with no history of variability prior to
2004. (Source: Sako et al. 2018)

For the photometric data of this data release see the ``sako18`` module.

Deviations from the standard UI:
  - This module provides spectroscopic data and as such the ``band_names``,
    and ``lambda_effective`` attributes are not available.

Cuts on returned data:
  - A spectra is included in the data release for object ``15301``, but no
    information about this spectra is provided in the spectra summary table
    (Table 9). This spectra is ignored.
  - Seven spectroscopically observed objects are missing a reported Ra, Dec,
    and redshift. These include: ``13046``, ``13346``, ``15833``, ``17134``,
    ``17135``, ``19819``, and ``6471``.
