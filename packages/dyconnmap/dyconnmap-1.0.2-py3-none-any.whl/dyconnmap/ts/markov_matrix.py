    """ Markov Matrix

    Markov matrix (also refered as "transition matrix") is a square matrix that tabulates
    the observed transition probabilities between symbols for a finite Markov Chain. It is a first-order descriptor
    by which the next symbol depends only on the current symbol (and not on the previous ones);
    a Markov Chain model.

    A transition matrix is formally depicted as:

    Given the probability :math:`Pr(j|i)` of moving between :math:`i` and :math:`j` elements,
    the transition matrix is depicted as:

    .. math::
        P = \\begin{pmatrix}
                      P_{1,1} & P_{1,2} & \\ldots & P_{1,j} & \\ldots & P_{1,S} \\\\
                      P_{2,1} & P_{2,2} & \\ldots & P_{2,j} & \\ldots & P_{2,S} \\\\
                      \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\
                      P_{i,1} & P_{i,2} & \\ldots & P_{i,j} & \\ldots & P_{i,S} \\\\
                      \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\
                      P_{S,1} & P_{S,2} & \\ldots & P_{S,j} & \\ldots & P_{S,S} \\\\
            \\end{pmatrix}

    Since the transition matrix is row-normalized, so as the total transition probability
    from state :math:`i` to all the others must be equal to :math:`1`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    symts : array-like, shape(N)
        One-dimensional discrete time series.

    states_from_length: bool or int, optional
        Used to account symbolic time series in which not all the symbols are present.
        That may happen when for example the symbols are drawn from different distributions.
        Default `True`, the size of the resulting Markov Matrix is equal to the number
        of unique symbols present in the time series. If `False`, the size will be the
        `highest symbolic state + 1`.
        You may also speficy the highest (inclusive) symbolic state.

    Returns
    -------
    mtx : matrix
        The transition matrix. The size depends the parameter `states_from_length`.
