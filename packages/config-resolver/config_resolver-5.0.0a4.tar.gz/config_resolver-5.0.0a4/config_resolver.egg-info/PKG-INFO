        Rationale
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        Many of the larger frameworks (not only web frameworks) offer their own
        configuration management. But it looks different everywhere. Both in code and
        in usage later on. Additionally, the operating system usually has some default,
        predictable place to look for configuration values. On Linux, this is ``/etc``
        and the `XDG Base Dir Spec
        <https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/0.8/>`_ (This instance is based
        on 0.8 of this spec).
        
        The code for finding these config files is always the same. But finding config
        files can be more interesting than that:
        
        * If config files contain passwords, the application should issue appropriate
          warnings if it encounters an insecure file and refuse to load it.
        
        * The expected structure in the config file can be versioned (think: schema).
          If an application is upgraded and expects new values to exist in an old
          version file, it should notify the user.
        
        * It should be possible to override the configuration per installed instance,
          even per execution.
        
        ``config_resolver`` tackles all these challenges in a simple-to-use drop-in
        module. The module uses no additional external modules (no additional
        dependencies, pure Python) so it can be used in any application without adding
        unnecessary bloat.
