        # Package Description :
        Python package for Outlier Removal Algorithm using z_score or iqr.   
        # Motivation :   
        This is a part of project - II made for UCS633 - Data analytics and visualization at TIET.

        # Algorithm :       
        * Z-SCORE : If the population mean and population standard deviation are known, the standard score of a raw score x is calculated as:     
        z = (x - mean) / std.          
        mean : is the mean of the sample.     
        std : is the standard deviation of the sample.    
        
        * Interquartile range : interquartile range (IQR), also called the midspread, middle 50%, or Hâ€‘spread, is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles.     
        IQR = Q3 âˆ’  Q1       
        The IQR of a set of values is calculated as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles, Q3 and Q1. Each quartile is a median calculated as follows :     
        Given an even 2n or odd 2n+1 number of values.      
        first quartile Q1 = median of the n smallest values          
        third quartile Q3 = median of the n largest values       
        The second quartile Q2 is the same as the ordinary median.        
        
        ### Getting started Locally :  
        > Run On Terminal       
          
        
        > Run In IDLE   
        
        
        > Run on Jupyter   
        Open terminal (cmd)   
        ```jupyter notebook```   
        Create a new python3 file.     
        
        
        
        ### OUTPUT :
        Removes all the valid rows contaning outlier values from the dataset and prints the number of rows removed along with the columns which were considered for the algorithm.    
         
        
        # TESTING : 
        * The package has been extensively tested on various datasets consisting varied types of expected and unexpected input data and any preprocessing , if required has been taken care of.
