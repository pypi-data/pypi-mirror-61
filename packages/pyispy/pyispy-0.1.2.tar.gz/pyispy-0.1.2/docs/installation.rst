Stable release
--------------

To install PyISpy, run this command in your terminal:

    $ pip install pyispy

This is the preferred method to install PyISpy, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
