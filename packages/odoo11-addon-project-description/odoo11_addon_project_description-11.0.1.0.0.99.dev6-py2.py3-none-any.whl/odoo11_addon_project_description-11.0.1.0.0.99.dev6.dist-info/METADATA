Project Description

This module extends the functionality of projects to support setting a
description for each project and allow you to search by that description.

Usage
=====

To set a description for a project, you need to:

#. Go to *Project > Project > Projects*.
#. Edit or create one.
#. You will see a new *Description* tab, with an HTML area to set the project's description.
