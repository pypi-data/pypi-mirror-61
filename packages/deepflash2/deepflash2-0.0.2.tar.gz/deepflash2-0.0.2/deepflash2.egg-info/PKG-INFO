        ## Install
        
        `pip install deepflash2`
        
        ## How to use
        
        ```python
        learn = Unet_Learner(train_generator, valid_generator)
        ```
        
        ```python
        learn.lr_find()
        learn.plot_loss()
        ```
        
        ```python
        learn.fit_one_cycle(100, validation_freq=5, max_lr=5e-4)
        ```
        
        ## Model Library
        
        This list contains download links to the weights of the selected models as well as an example of their corresponding training images and masks.
