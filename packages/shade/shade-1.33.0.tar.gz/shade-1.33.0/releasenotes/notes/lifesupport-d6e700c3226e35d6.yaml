    The relationship between shade and openstacksdk has been decoupled
    and the shade library is now officially in maintenance mode. Bugfixes
    are welcome, and the library remains supported, but no new features
    will be accepted. Developers are strongly encouraged to migrate to
    openstacksdk which has the same code but is being actively driven
    forward.
