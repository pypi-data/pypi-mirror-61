    ``enabled=False`` is passed explicitly.

    [`bug 2001080 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2001080>`_]
    Project update will only update the enabled field of projects when
    ``enabled=True`` or ``enabled=False`` is passed explicitly. The previous
    behavior had ``enabled=True`` as the default.
