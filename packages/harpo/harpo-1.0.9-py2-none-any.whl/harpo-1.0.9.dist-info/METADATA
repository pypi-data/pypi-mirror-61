Description
###########

    Harpocrates (Ancient Greek: Ἁρποκράτης) was the god of silence, secrets and confidentiality.

**Harpo** is GPG-based secret storage/sharing library.

It is aims to be a convenient wrapper around GPG and tries to solve following problems:

* Store secrets in a repository (currently only git is supported) in a secure manner
* Provide role-based access to the stored secrets
* Provide an easy way to reencrypt secrets

It was inspired by `blackbox <https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox>`_ by StackExchange.
