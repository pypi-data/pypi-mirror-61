Callbacks in order to gain control over the training loop.

A callback is a set of functions to be called at given stages of the training procedure.
You can use callbacks to implement logging, measure custom metrics or get insight about the
training procedure.
You can pass a list of callbacks (derived from :py:class:`ashpy.callbacks.callback.Callback`)
(as the keyword argument callbacks)
to the `.call()` method of the Trainer.
The relevant methods of the callbacks will then be called at each stage of the training.

Order:
    .. code-block::

        --on_train_start

        ----on_epoch_start

        ------on_batch_start

        ------on_batch_end

        ----on_epoch_end

        --on_train_end

        on_exception â€“ if an Exception was raised

        on_event - Called when an event is triggered

The basic class is :py:class:`ashpy.callbacks.callback.Callback` .
All possible events as listed as Enum inside :py:class:`ashpy.callbacks.events.Event` .
