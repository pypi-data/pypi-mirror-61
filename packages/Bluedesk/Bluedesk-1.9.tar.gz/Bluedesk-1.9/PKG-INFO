        # Requirements
        
        ## Prepare **bluepy** system dependencies:
        
        The code needs an executable `bluepy-helper` to be compiled from C source. This is done
        automatically if you use the recommended pip installation method (see below). Otherwise,
        you can rebuild it using the Makefile in the `bluepy` directory.
        
        To install the current released version, on most Debian-based systems:
        
            $ sudo apt-get install python-pip libglib2.0-dev
        
        On Fedora do:
        
            $ sudo dnf install python-pip glib2-devel
        
        For Python 3, you may need to use `pip3`:
        
            $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip libglib2.0-dev
        
        
        # Installation
        
            sudo pip install bluedesk
        
        
        
        > To use the command without `sudo` run this command:
        
            sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' /usr/local/lib/(python3.7 OR your version)/dist-packages/bluepy/bluepy-helper
        
        > where python3.7 is relative to your current used version.
