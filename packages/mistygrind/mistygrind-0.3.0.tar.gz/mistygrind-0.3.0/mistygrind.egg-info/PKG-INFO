        ==========
        
        Abstract
        --------
        
        a tool for static analysis of Misty skills and offboard Misty REST API clients
        
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Install this Python package::
        
          pip install mistygrind
        
        Try to get the version from the command-line::
        
          mistygrind -V
        
        which should cause a string like "0.1.0" to be printed.
        Check for dependencies::
        
          mistygrind --check-deps
        
        which will decide if dependencies are satisfied, and if not, give hints.
        Dependencies include:
        
        * `ESLint <https://eslint.org/>`_
        
        
        Use as a Misty virtual machine
        ------------------------------
        
        Try ::
        
          mistygrind --vm
        
        which will start listening on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) at port 8888.
