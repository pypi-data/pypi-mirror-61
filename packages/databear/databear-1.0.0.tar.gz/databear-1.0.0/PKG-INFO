Description: # DataBear
        General purpose data aquistion, processing, and logging platform written in Python.
        DataBear is hardware independent, but is meant to be easily integrated via a custom
        hardware interface provided by the user.
        
        ### Goals:
        * Easy to use - intuitive setup and configuration.
        * Versatile - use on any hardware device that runs Python.
        * Extendible - add new methods for measurement as needed.
        
        ### Some potential usage scenarios:
        Here are some random ideas to give a sense for DataBear capabilities (some capabilities under development).
        * Run DataBear on a Raspberry Pi (https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to read a Modbus temperature sensor.  The sensor could be connected to a USB port on the Pi via an RS485 to USB converter and data could be read every second, averaged, and stored to CSV.
        * Integrate DataBear into an existing Linux based measurement platform, such as the Dyacon MDL-700 (https://dyacon.com). In this case, DataBear is utilized by pyMDL (https://github.com/dyacon/pyMDL) to schedule measurement and storage, while pyMDL specifies hardware configuration.
