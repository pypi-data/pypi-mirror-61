Description: # Flask CRUD
        _Why repeat yourself?_
        
        # What is this?
        Right now, a work in progress.
        
        This library aims to tie together Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Smorest to implement a sane default but easily customizable CRUD API based on SQLAlchemy models inside of Flask.
        
        # Who is this for?
        This library is only useful if your application uses:
        * [Flask-Smorest](https://flask-smorest.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
        * [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/)
        * [Flask-JWT-Extended](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
        
        
        # Where to look?
        Look at `smorest_crud/test/app.py`
