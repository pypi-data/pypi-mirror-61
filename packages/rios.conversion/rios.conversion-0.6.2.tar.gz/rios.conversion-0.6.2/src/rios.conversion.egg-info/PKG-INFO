        Overview
        ********
        
        RIOS.CONVERSION is a `Python`_ package that supports 
        converting research instruments in various formats 
        to and from `RIOS`_ data structures.
        
        The following APIs have been implemented:
        
        - redcap_to_rios
        
          Converts a REDCap Data Dictionary format to 
          the RIOS Instrument, Form, and CalculationSet 
          format.
        
        - rios_to_redcap
        
          Converts a RIOS Instrument, Form, and CalculationSet 
          to the REDCap Data Dictionary format.
          
        - qualtrics_to_rios
        
          Converts a Qualtrics data dictionary to the RIOS
          Instrument and Form format.
        
        - rios_to_qualtrics
        
          Converts a RIOS Instrument, Form, and CalculationSet 
          to the Qualtrics format.
          
        Import these functions for use::
        
          >>> from rios.conversion import (
          >>>     redcap_to_rios,
          >>>     qualtrics_to_rios,
          >>>     rios_to_redcap,
          >>>     rios_to_qualtrics,
          >>> )
        
        Notes:
        
        The question order, text, and associated enumerations, 
        are all converted correctly; however the converted expressions
        used for "calculated fields" and "skip logic", as well as the display
        niceties of section breaks and separators will most likely require 
        some "tweaking" because the various systems model pages, events and actions 
        differently.
        
        For example a RIOS calculation is an expression applied to an assessment,
        independently of the data collection, while a REDCap "calculated field"
        is a read-only field which evaluates its expression and displays the result
        during data collection.
