# Westerly

    A wind blows over the C
    so strong that it moves 'const' you see
    from the west to the east
    some of 'em at least

Westerly is a script to re-arrange `const` in your C/C++ source files to 
follow east-const convention. Plenty of articles have been written about 
why you would want to do that, I'm not going to repeat the arguments here 
and will instead assume that you have arrived here because you are 
convinced of the merits.

## Installation

Todo once available PyPI
...

## Usage


Once installed you can use the following command to run westerly on a 
source file:

```bash
westerly $file
```

By default, the rewritten source will be written to stdout. To perform 
the replacement in-place, pass the `--in-place` option:

```bash
westerly --in-place $file
```

It is highly recommended that you only run westerly on version-controlled 
source-code, so you can go back in case something goes wrong. Westerly uses 
a set of heuristics to determine which consts to move and where, it doesn't 
actually have a full understanding of C++ syntax. No heuristic is perfect. 
**You have been warned.**

It is also highly recommended to pass the changed code through 
`clang-format` (or `git clang-format`) as westerly will sometimes mess up 
formatting a bit. 


# FAQ

## Why, oh why?

Because sometimes you have solved all business cases and all that there
is left to do is to cleanup up code and make it consistent. Yes, seriously.

## Why doesn't westerly have options to control spacing around const?

I get it, you don't like the spaces westerly puts around `const`. You 
would rather prefer to have it output `const&` instead of `const &`. You 
are not alone. Surrounding `const` with spaces on boths sides is just 
the pragmatic choice as there is no danger of fusing `const` with 
surrounding tokens by accident. As mentioned above, you should pass your 
code through `clang-format` after running westerly, which has plenty of 
options to configure spaces around `const`.
