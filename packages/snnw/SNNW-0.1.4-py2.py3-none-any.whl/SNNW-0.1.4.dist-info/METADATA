# Slowest-Neural-Net-in-the-West
My custom neural net architecture written in Python to 
practice my ML skills.


## Install
Make a new Python virtual environment (version >= 3.6).
Install this project with pip. In terminal, run

`pip3 install SNNW`

## Download MNIST dataset
Open a new Python shell or Jupyter Notebook and run

`import SNNW`

Set `raw_dir = ` the directory where you want to
save the MNIST raw data files. Run

`SNNW.dataset.mnist.download_raw(raw_dir)`

Set `png_dir = ` the directory where you want to
save the MNIST .png images and path text files. Run

`SNNW.dataset.mnist.raw_to_png(raw_dir, png_dir)`

Set `npy_dir = ` the directory where you want to
save the MNIST .npy image and label numpy arrays. Run

`SNNW.dataset.mnist.png_to_npy(png_dir, npy_dir)`

## Get model config
Set `config_path = ` the path to where you want to save
the training/testing model's config file. Run

`SNNW.nn.config.get_config_1(config_path)`
or
`SNNW.nn.config.get_config_2(config_path)`

to write a sample config file to `config_path`,
or write your own config file and place it where
`config_path` points to.

If you write a custom config file, make sure that it
follows the given format to prevent run-time errors!


## Train model
Set `model_dir = ` the directory where the trained model's
weights and biases will be stored.

Set `train_image_path = ` the path to where the .npy file for
the training image arrays are located.
This file should be located inside the `npy_dir`
you specified earlier. 

Set `train_label_path = ` the path to where the .npy file for
the training label arrays are located.
This file should be located inside the `npy_dir`
you specified earlier.

Set `steps = ` the number of training steps you would
like to train for. The default is `60,000`.

Set `learning_rate = ` the learning rate you would like to 
train with. The default is `5e-4`.

Run `SNNW.train(model_dir, config_path, train_image_path,
train_label_path, steps, learning_rate)`.

*Note:* if you get a NaN error or "not a probability array"
error, then you probably have a vanishing or exploding
gradient problem. To fix this, try adjusting the learning rate.
The default learning rate and number of steps included
have been tested to work with both included models.

## Test model

Set `test_image_path = ` the path to where the .npy file for
the training image arrays are located.
This file should be located inside the `npy_dir`
you specified earlier. 

Set `test_label_path = ` the path to where the .npy file for
the training label arrays are located.
This file should be located inside the `npy_dir`
you specified earlier.

Run `SNNW.evaluate(model_dir, config_path, test_image_path,
test_label_path)`.
