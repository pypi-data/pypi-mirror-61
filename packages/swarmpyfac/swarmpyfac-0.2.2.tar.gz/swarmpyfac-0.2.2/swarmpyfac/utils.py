""" The swarm_util module provides a host of utilities function.

This module stores a vararity of different functions and constants,
which is deemed general usefull when working on swarm data,
specifically when such data is loaded from 
the viresclient python client.

There is a mix of general constants, such as the permuability of vacum,
and different types of functions.
The functions can generally be categorised into twi types:
Functions for working on arrays of scalars or vectors,
and functions to work with viresclient.
These categories have their own sections, with a short descriptions on each.
    
Array Utilities
---------------
These functions are used to work on numpy arrays of scalars or vectors.
They are mostly geared toward dealign with time-like series.

pack_3d
    Take 3 equaly long arrays of scalars and make an array of 3d vectors.
as_3d
    Like pack_3d, but uses dublicates of the same array of scalars.
    Usefull for aggregating scalar-vector operations over an array.
map_3d
    A map function over arrays of 3d vectors,
    where the function maped takes a 3d vector to a 3d vector.
NEC_to_VSC
    Build a transformation from the NEC frame to the VSC frame.
    The return is a function, which will transfrom
    its input from the NEC frame to the VSC frame.
delta
    Calculate the changes of a time-like series.
means
    Calculate the intermediate value (by linear interpolation)
    for a time-like series.
spherical_delta
    Calculate the changes in spherical coordinates as NEC frame vectors.
curl
    Calculate a single component of curl for an array of vectors.
inclination
    Calculate the inclination for an awway of vectors.
    
Viresclient
-----------
These are the functions related to fetching and loading data
from the viresclient python client.

request_data
    Builds and send a request for a CDF file to vires.
    Most usefull for defaulting all the relevant parameters.
read_cdf
    A function to read a cdf file based on a dictionary pairing
    of attributes you want to read from the cdf file,
    and what you want to refere to them as afterwards.

        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is the options
        for a filter to be applied to the data.
    target_url : str, optional
        The full url for the server to request the data at.
        Defaults to 'https://staging.viresdisc.vires.services/openows'
    collection : str, optional
        See viresclient set_collection. Defaults to 'SW_OPER_MAGA_LR_1B'.
    product_options : dict, optional
        Extra options to viresclient set_products.
        Defaults to {'auxiliaries': ['QDLat', 'QDLon']}
    sampling_step : str, optional
        Describes the sampling frequency, 
        since vires may otherwise downsample the data.
        The default is 1Hz by 'PT1S'.
    models : list(str), optional
        The models calculated at the data points.
        See viresclient set_products models for details.
        Defaults to [
        'MCO_SHA_2C', 'MLI_SHA_2C',
        'MMA_SHA_2C-Primary', 'MMA_SHA_2C-Secondary']
    measurements : list(str), optional
        Measured quantities to be included for each data point.
        Defaults to ['F', 'B_NEC']
    to_file : boolean, optional
        If set to true, the the result will be saved to a file as cdf, otherwise the datastructure will be returned as is.
        Defaults to True.
    **credentials : **str, optional
        extra parameters to pass to SwarmRequest. Intented for passing credentails (though other options are also possible). It is backwards compatible with calls using parameter names for credentials. The specific credentials are as below:
        token : str, optional
            Token for authenticating with the target_url.
            You need either a token or a username/password combination.
            The default options for the website will be used if all are set to None.
        username : str, optional
            username for authenticating with the target_url.
            You need either a token or a username/password combination.
            The default options for the website will be used if all are set to None.
        password : str, optional
            username for authenticating with the target_url.
            You need either a token or a username/password combination.
            The default options for the website will be used if all are set to None.

def read_cdf(file, **name_pairings):
    """ Read data from a cdf file.
    
    Read a cdf file and construct a dictionary based on
    name_parings. This may open and read a file as a side-effect.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    file : str or cdfread
        The file to read the data from. 
        Accepts both a string filepath to the file and an opened cdfread file.
    **name_pairings
        Pairs of names used to link a name in the output with its 
        corrisponding name in the cdf file.
        
    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The keys are the keywords used in name_parings,
        while the values are the variables loaded from
        the cdf file with the name of the corrisponding argument.
        
    Examples
    --------
    We can directly ask for variables:
    
    >>> from pyfac.utils import *  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> read_cdf('tempdata.cdf') # doctest: +SKIP
    {}
    >>> read_cdf('tempdata.cdf', time='Timestamp') # doctest: +SKIP,+ELLIPSIS
    {'time': array([...])}
    
    We can also make use of predefined options:
    
    >>> options = {'time': 'Timestamp', 'B_base': 'B_NEC'}
    >>> read_cdf('tempdata.cdf', **options) # doctest: +SKIP,+ELLIPSIS
    {'time': array([...]), 'B_base': array([[...]])}
    
    Note
    ----
    These examples are skiped by doctest due to dependency 
    on the existance of a 'tempdata.cdf' file.
