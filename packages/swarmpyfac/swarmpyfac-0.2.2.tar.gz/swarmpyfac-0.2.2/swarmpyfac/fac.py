""" The fac module is used for calculated field alligned currents.

This module contains functions used to calculated field alligned currents,
and some of the components used in the calculations.
This module is dependent on the swarm_util module, which contains
functions for utilities and some of the more general components needed.

This module currently only allows caluculation of the single satelite
version of the FAC product, and it uses data available from viresclient's
python client or another data source with similar format.
The major difference between this and the official ESA product,
is that the input from models are their effects at each measurement point,
since this is the format delivered by viresclient.

This means that there is a small algorithmic difference compared
to what is used in the official ESA products,
though experimental comparison have found the difference 
to be less than  1.2*10^(-4) micro A/m^2, and the average
difference to be less than 1% of this.

Running this module as a script will (outside of running some tests)
perform the default experiment.

Overview
--------
This section lists each of the functions in this module,
and give a short description of them.
You can use this as an easier way to look up what you might need.

split_models
    Takes measurements and up to several models,
    and returns the combined model and the residual on the measurements.
radial_current
    Calculate the radial currents for time-like series.
single_sat_fac
    Calculate the field alligned currents
    for a single satelinte on time-like series.
single_sat_fac_full
    Like single_sat_fac, but it handles input from a dictionary,
    and can figure out which models are pressent itself.
fetch_data
    Fetch the data needed, and can figure out itself whether
    it needs to download it first.
fac_from_file
    Do the entire single satelite field alligned currents calculations,
    but takes a possible file as input the same way as fetch_data.

Examples
--------
>>> from pyfac.fac import fac_from_file  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> import datetime as date
>>> results, input_data = fac_from_file(
...     start=date.datetime(2017, 4, 11),
...     end=date.datetime(2017, 4, 12),
...     force_download=True)  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> lat, fac = results[1][:, 0], results[3]  # doctest: +SKIP

    It is assumed that the models combine linearly with each
    other and a residual (meaning modelA + modelB + residual = baseline,

    -------
    tuple of ndarray
        A tuple, with the first component being an ndarray of the residual
