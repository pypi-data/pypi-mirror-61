Module Overview
===============
This page is a compililation of the overviews of each of the 3 modules. First a short overview of each of the module, the long one is on other sections below:

- ``swarmpyfac.fac``, the main module. It contains functions to calculate field aligned currents, and related scientific steps. It is rolled into the main package, so you can call its functionality directly from there.
- ``swarmpyfac.utils``, the utility module. It contains functions for the underlaying mathematics, and should also be usefull for computing other products.
