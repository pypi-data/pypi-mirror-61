        AsteriskLint is a suite of tools to check syntax of your Asterisk PBX
        configuration files.
        
        Alright, enough talking. Some examples please!
        
        For an online example see `<https://asterisklint.osso.pub/>`_. For CLI
        examples, keep reading:
        
        
        Invocation
        ----------
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ asterisklint
            usage: asterisklint [-h] COMMAND
            asterisklint: error: the following arguments are required: COMMAND
        
            $ asterisklint ls
            builtin:
              ls                    List available commands.
        
            /usr/lib/python/dist-packages:
              dialplan-check        Do sanity checks on dialplan. Takes 'extensions.conf'
                                    as argument. Suppress error classes using ALINT_IGNORE.
              dialplan-show         Show dialplan like Asterisk does with CLI command
                                    "dialplan show". Takes 'extensions.conf' as argument.
              func_odbc-check       Do sanity checks on func_odbc.conf. Takes
                                    'func_odbc.conf' as argument. Suppress error classes
                                    using ALINT_IGNORE.
              ident-scan            Report similarly named contexts, labels and variables.
                                    Takes 'extensions.conf' as argument. All parse errors
                                    are suppressed.
              modules-show          Show which modules, apps and functions are used by the
                                    dialplan. Takes 'extensions.conf' as argument.
        
            Place custom commands in ~/.asterisklint/asterisklint/commands.
        
        
        Take this little dialplan snippet, that we'll call ``extensions.conf``::
        
            [default]
            exten => _8[2-9]x,1,NoOp
             same => n,GoSub(somewhere,s,1(argument1,argument2)
             same => n,Payback(audiofile)
        
        Now run the ``dialplan-check`` command on it:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ ALINT_IGNORE=H_DP_ asterisklint dialplan-check extensions.conf
            extensions.conf:2 H_PAT_NON_CANONICAL: pattern '_8[2-9]x' is not in the canonical form '_8NX'
            extensions.conf:3 W_APP_BAD_CASE: app 'GoSub' does not have the proper Case 'Gosub'
            extensions.conf:3 W_APP_BALANCE: app data '1(argument1,argument2' looks like unbalanced parentheses/quotes/curlies
            extensions.conf:4 E_APP_MISSING: app 'Payback' does not exist, dialplan will halt here!
            extensions.conf:3 E_DP_GOTO_NOCONTEXT: context not found for goto to somewhere, s, 1
        
        It had a lot to complain about that little snippet. But it was right. We
        even suppressed two hints about a missing ``[general]`` and ``[global]``
        context using ``ALINT_IGNORE``.
        
        Not everything it checks is documented, and it does not check everything
        that we like yet. But it's a start. Bug reports are welcome. Feature requests
        prefer to be accompanied by a patch :-)
        
        Try out ``modules-show`` if you use ``autoload=no`` in your ``modules.conf``.
        
        All commands show help if asked:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ asterisklint modules-show --help
            usage: asterisklint modules-show [-h] [--func-odbc FUNC_ODBC_CONF]
                                             [EXTENSIONS_CONF]
        
            Show which modules, apps and functions are used by the dialplan. Useful when
            you use autoload=no in your modules.conf. Beware that you do need more modules
            than just these listed.
        
            positional arguments:
              EXTENSIONS_CONF       path to extensions.conf
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              --func-odbc FUNC_ODBC_CONF
                                    path to func_odbc.conf, will be read automatically if
                                    found in same the same dir as extensions.conf; set
                                    empty to disable
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Installation is a matter of ``python3 setup.py install``. Or, for more
        convenience, install a PyPI uploaded version through ``pip3(1)``:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ sudo pip3 install asterisklint
            ...
            Successfully installed asterisklint
        
        
        The ``dialplan-check`` comes in handy as a git commit hook, for example
        ``.git/hooks/pre-commit``:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            #!/bin/sh
            export ALINT_IGNORE=  # adjust as needed
        
            asterisklint dialplan-check PATH/TO/extensions.conf
            ret=$?
            if test $ret -ne 0; then
                echo >&2
                echo 'One or more dialplan syntax errors. Please fix before committing.' >&2
                exit $ret
            fi
        
            exit 0
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        * Expression parsing.
        * Web: state is kept between requests:
        
          - on 500-error, the next user may get older errors (because of the
            messagedef singleton)
          - the BackGround/Background hack is stored between requests
        
        * Log/store Set'd variables and compare against Read variables. Also log
          variables Set through the ARRAY() function. (And HASH?)
        * Fix various includes issues:
        
          - Recursive #includes probably make asterisklint run out of stack.
          - Add checks for recursive dialplan-includes.
          - Scan for missing dialplan-includes.
        
        * Trim CALLERID match (as used in FreePBX dialplan).
        * Func_odbc parsing improvements:
        
          - check for missing synopsis/syntax (compare syntax to ARGn count)
          - check for correct usage of VAL (write only) and ARG and missing SQL_ESC
          - yield the odbc functions instead of contexts like it does now
        
          (See more in func_odbc.py.)
        * Add ``app-check`` command to do dialplan checks of individual lines.
        * Add ``expr-check`` command to do expression (``$[...]``) checks.
          E.g. add::
        
            exten => X!,1,Set(boolean=$["" <555> = 1234])
            ; Set(boolean=$[${CALLERID(all)} = 1234])
            ; incorrectly using 'all', should use 'num'
            ==> syntax error, unexpected '=', expecting '-' or '!' or '(' or '<token>'
        
        * Allow multiline variables using += (key=val; key+=more-val).
        * Investigate whether exten=>s,n(label)... exten=>s,label+10... is valid.
        * For the Goto/Gosub-visiting:
        
          - Attempt to match contexts by regex if there are $VARs involved?
          - Allow a "noqa" style exceptions to be placed in a comment?
        
        * Improve documentation as needed.
        * Before 1.0, start adding versioning -- including semver -- so users can
          depend on a stable API from their custom scripts. Also version the scripts
          (commands) so they won't talk to older/newer libs if that poses a problem.
        
        
        BUGS
        ----
        
        * The library is very much in flux. Don't expect it to stabilize any time
          soon. Pay attention to versions!
        * Multiline comments (``;-- ... --;``) are unsupported. Does anyone use those?
        * Limits aren't checked (dialplan lines are limited at 255 or 8191 bytes
          for LOW_MEMORY and normal mode respectively).
        * The library/suite is Python3 only. Right now the effort to make it Python2
          compatible is larger than the demand. In the future Python2 compatibility
          will become even less relevant.

        0.4.2 (2020-02-19)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        * Don't choke on too many Gosub arguments.
        * Fixes for various python 3 versions.
        
        Improvements:
        
        * Added PJSIP_HEADER, PJSIP_AOR, PJSIP_CONTACT, PJSIP_ENDPOINT.
        
        0.4.1 (2018-10-10)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        * Cope with ${vars} in FUNC() arguments.
        * Fix typo's in func_odbc-check.
        * Speedup in dialplan goto-parsing.
        * Unbreak custom command support.
        
        Improvements:
        
        * Add missing app_milliwatt, app_mysql, app_originate,
          func_audiohookinherit, func_volume_register.
        * Add preliminary func_odbc-annotate command; not feature complete.
        * Add the (now obsolete) vg.py contrib command which alters certain file
          reading functions so a slightly different syntax is accepted.
        * Check applications called in ExecIf().
        
        0.4.0 (2017-04-05)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        * When doing dialplan-file mutations, operate on the symlink target
          instead of replacing the symlink.
        * Don't install README files into /usr, but in
          /usr/share/doc/asterisklint (or with a different prefix).
        * Also search in included contexts for priority labels.
        
        Improvements:
        
        * Add various apps:
          - Authenticate, ControlPlayback, PickupChan
          - PickupOld1v4 (a workaround, see ASTERISK-26464)
          - VoiceMailPlayMsg, VMSayName,
          - ContinueWhile, EndWhile, ExitWhile, While,
          - AGI, DeadAGI, EAGI,
          - StopMusicOnHold
        * Add various functions:
          - DB, DB_EXISTS, DB_KEYS, DB_DELETE,
          - MD5, TIMEOUT
          - LOCAL, LOCAL_PEEK, STACK_PEEK
        * Add initial checks of function parameters: nothing more than the
          parentheses check we already used on undefined apps.
        * Add application Set() support. Add function SET() support. This also
          enables checking calls to writable functions.
        * Allow both the "BackGround" and "Background" spelling, as long as
          you choose one consistently.
        * A bunch of refactoring to make BetterCodeHub happy. If you've made
          custom subcommands, look at the MainBase class.
        * Add test with Asterisk 13 sample dialplan as input.
        * Add web frontend into repository.
        
        0.3.0 (2016-06-08)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Add preliminary Goto/Gosub scanning: the dialplan-check now tries to
          find non-existent goto destinations. New error classes:
          E_DP_GOTO_CONTEXT_NOLABEL, E_DP_GOTO_NOCONTEXT, E_DP_GOTO_NOLABEL,
          W_DP_GOTO_CONTEXT_NOEXTEN.
        * Add preliminary app argument checking. New error classes:
          E_APP_ARG_IFCONST, E_APP_ARG_IFEMPTY, E_APP_ARG_SYNTAX.
        * Add new command: ident-scan. It lists used contexts, labels and
          variables and does a poor attempt at finding typo's by comparing
          them against each other.
        * Add Asterisk apps: NoCDR, Record.
        * The commands taking a path to extensions.conf now default to scanning
          for it in the current directory.
        * Python3.5 testcase compatibility fix.
        
        0.2.1 (2016-01-29)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Don't look in __init__ for custom commands.
        
        0.2.0 (2016-01-29)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Add partial func_odbc checking.
        * Add new command: func_odbc-check
        * Do func_odbc checks for modules-show and dialplan-show, so you don't
          get flooded with E_FUNC_MISSING errors if you use func_odbc.
        * Fix a few variable/dialplan parsing bugs, improve some.
        
        0.1.0 (2016-01-15)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Initial release.
        * The following commands are available:
          dialplan-check, dialplan-show, modules-show
