Description: # QA-Board
        **QA-Board** helps Algorithms/QA engineers build great products with powerful *quality evaluation* and *collaboration* tools.
        
        > QA-Board is not released yet, and likely won't work *yet* for you because it expects running on our infra...
        >
        > We're working on it! **Status: https://github.com/Samsung/qaboard/issues/1**
        
        ## Features
        - **Organize, View and Compare Results**, **Tuning/Optimization**
        - **Web-based:** sharable URLs, no install needed.
        - **Visualizations:** support for quantitative metrics, and many file formats: advanced image viewer, support for videos, plotly graphs, text, pointclouds, embedded HTML...
        - **Integrations:** direct access from Git/CI, easily exportable results, API, links to the code, trigger jobs...
        
        ## Benefits
        - **Scale R&D:** enable engineers to achieve more and be more productive.
        - **Faster Time-to-Market:** collaboration across teams, workflow integration..
        - **Quality:** uncover issues earlier, KPIs, tuning, reporting...
        
        
        ## Get in touch
        We are looking for feedback and insights from outside Samsung. This will help us set the direction for `qaboard`.
        
        We think you could be interested if have projects where:
        - unit tests are not enough (ML, operational research...), and a loss function doesn't tell the whole story. Maybe because...
        - there are performance / quality trade-offs, or different configurations of your code you need to compare (hardware design, mobile/embedded...).
        - you need advanced visualizations to make sense of results (statistics, image processing, 3d sensors, sensing and decision tasks...) and need tools to dive down into outputs.
        - lifecycles are complex, with many stakeholders (algo, hardware, software, QA, production...)

        ## Getting Started
        [Read the docs!](http://qa-docs/docs/installation) You will learn how to:
        - install QA-Board's CLI wrapper
        - run a QA-Board server
        - wrap your code with QA-Board
        - view output files and KPIs
        - ...and improve your integration with many guides: bit-accuracy, tuning, etc.
        
        ## Code organization
        Each section has its own README:
        - [qatools](qatools): provides the `qa` CLI wrapper than runs your code, and the `import qatools` package.
        - [qaboard-backend](qaboard-backend/) exposes an HTTP API used to read/write all the metadata on runs.
        - [qaboard-webapp](qaboard-webapp/) is the frontend that displays results.
        - [thirdparty](thirdparty/):
          * [Cantaloupe](https://medusa-project.github.io/cantaloupe/) IIIF server, used to "stream" large images to the users.
        
        > **WIP:** we're merging multiple repos into one, expect those path to not be 100% accurate!
