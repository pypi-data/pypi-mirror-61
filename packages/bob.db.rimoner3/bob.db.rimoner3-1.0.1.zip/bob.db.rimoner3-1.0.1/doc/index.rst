RIM-ONE Release 3 
=========================================

This package is part of the signal-processing and machine learning toolbox Bob_. 
It provides an interface for the `RIM-ONE r3 Dataset`_. This package does not contain 
the original data files, which need to be obtained through the link above.

The dataset contains 159 stereo eye fundus images with a resolution of 2144 x 1424. The right 
part of the stereo image is disregarded. Two sets of ground-truths for optic disc and optic 
cup are available. The first set is commonly used for training and testing. The second set acts 
as a "human" baseline.

If you use this package, please cite the authors of the database::
