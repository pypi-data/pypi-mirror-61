TUI is a module for making custom CLI/Console App's with python


## Terminal suport
- [x] Mac
- [X] Linux
- [ ] Windows CMD

## Features
* Label's
* Keybindings
* Everything so far is in python

### Reason For Using this module.
* Game
    * Text based games (aka the real reason that lead me to make this module)
    * Tetras
    * Packman
    * Hangman
    * Block Break

* Tools
    * Hacking tools
    * Development tools

Really there is is not reason, I only made this to have something to do and 
build my knowledge in python.  I will though make a few games with it after I get this 
module working. Lots and lots of work ahead still.


### Screen Shot
This is what I have so far, not much but it's a work in progress.

To get this example do
```
clitui matrix
```
in terminal and watch it rain!

Automatic detection of terminal size, not yet dynamically made. Only finds
size of terminal when being created so if you resize the terminal the program will not.
