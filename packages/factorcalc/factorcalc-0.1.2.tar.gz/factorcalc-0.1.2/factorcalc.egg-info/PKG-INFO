Description: factor.f(integer)
            factor.f(int) -> list of int -- provides a list of all the factors of the first argument
        
        factor.gcf(num1, num2)
            factor.gcf(translatable to int, translatable to int) -> int -- provides the greatest common factor of the integers in the first argument
        
        factor.prime(integer)
            factor.prime(int) -> bool -- checks if the first argument is prime
        
        factor.primes(minimum, maximum)
            factor.primes(int, int) -> list of int -- returns all prime numbers within the range of the first and second arguments including the arguments themselves
        
        mult(number, quantity)
            factorcalc.mult(int, int > 0) -> list of int -- returns a list containing, in order, multiples of the first argument with the second argument being its length
            This module does not relate to factor calculation but to multiple calculation. It has been added beause it might be of use.
