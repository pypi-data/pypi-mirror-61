v0.6.0, IN PROGRESS
    - Possibly breaking changes:
        - Refactored internals to allow more control over individual components of drawing.
          Should have no effect unless the user is accessing internal attributes of the Element object.
          This also adds the `segments` list to the Element object, which allows finer control over 
          individual bits of the drawing.
        - Updated add_label so that "top" labels should always appear on top, regardless of flip/reverse
        - Swapped the direction of current sources, so that a current source with direction "up" has the
          arrow pointing up.

    - Enhancements:
        - Added "zorder" parameter in the element definition dictionary and `add` method
        - Added `elements.ic` and `elements.multiplexer` functions as replacements to `blackbox` and `mux`.
          These include more functionality such as adjusting indiviudal pin rotation, color, and inverter bubbles.
        - Labels can be placed relative to an anchor position using the `add_label` method. This could be
          useful, for example, in labeling pin numbers on a logic gate or opamp.
        
    - Circuit Elements:
        - Added: MIC, MOTOR
        - Added new anchors to OPAMPs for power supply and offset nulls.

    - Documentation:
        - Upgraded documentation to Sphinx and moved to readthedocs.org at https://schemdraw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
        - Changed preferred import to `import SchemDraw.elements as elm`. Apparently some people still
          use import * with pylab; this suggestion will help avoid conflicts.
