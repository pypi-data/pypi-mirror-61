"""
This module contains the text scanner.

The Scanner is nothing more than an iterator over a string, returning the
current character being read, and providing ancillary functions such as keeping
track of line and column numbers when it becomes important to raise an
Exception.
"""


class Scanner:
    """
    The scanner for the Lexer.

    An input text is iterated over, providing characters on demand to the
    lexer. The scanner could provide a couple of ancillary functions, and could
    also acts as a linter in future versions of this tool, warning the user
    about syntax errors.

    Attributes:
        _line  (iterable): Current line to scan characters for.
        _raw   (list)    : The source code, line by line.
        _text  (iterable): An iterator on the lines of the source code.
        column (integer) : The position of the caret in the line of code.
        line   (integer) : The line of code being scanned.

        Instantiates a new scanner.

        The scanner is instantiated and starts fetching the source code
        provided.

        Parameters:
            text: The source code to scan

        Raises:
            StopIteration: If the source code is empty.
