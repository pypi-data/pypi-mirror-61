   This page gives a condensed overview of these features, along with features
   outside of these classes.

   This page is meant as the starting point for new users. It is
   populated with links to the :ref:`API reference` and User Guide.

Background
==========

ProPlot is an object-oriented matplotlib wrapper. The "wrapper" part means that
ProPlot's features are largely a *superset* of matplotlib.
You can use your favorite plotting commands like
`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter`, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contour`, and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolor` like you always have.
The "object-oriented" part means that ProPlot's features are implemented with *subclasses* of the `~matplotlib.figure.Figure` and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes` classes.

If you tend to use `~matplotlib.pyplot` and are not familiar with figure and axes *classes*, check out `this guide from the matplotlib documentation <https://matplotlib.org/api/api_overview.html#the-pyplot-api>`__. Working with objects directly tends to be more clear and concise than `~matplotlib.pyplot`, makes things easier when working with multiple figures and axes, and is certainly more "`pythonic <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`__". Therefore, although some ProPlot features may still work, we do not officially support the `~matplotlib.pyplot` API.


Importing proplot
=================

We recommend importing ProPlot as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   import proplot as plot

This differentiates ProPlot from the usual ``plt`` abbreviation used for the `~matplotlib.pyplot` module.
Importing ProPlot immediately adds several new colormaps, property cyclers, color names, and fonts to matplotlib. See :ref:`Colormaps`, :ref:`Color cycles`, and :ref:`Colors and fonts` for details.

Figure and axes classes
=======================
Making figures in ProPlot always begins with a call to the
`~proplot.subplots.subplots` command:

.. code-block:: python

   f, axs = plot.subplots(...)

`~proplot.subplots.subplots` is modeled after
matplotlib's native `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots` command.
It creates an instance of ProPlot's
`~proplot.subplots.Figure` class
populated with instances of ProPlot's
`~proplot.axes.Axes` classes.
See :ref:`The basics`
and :ref:`Subplots features` for details.

Each `~proplot.axes.Axes` returned by `~proplot.subplots.subplots`
belongs to one of the following three child classes:

* `~proplot.axes.XYAxes`: For plotting simple data with *x* and *y* coordinates.
* `~proplot.axes.ProjAxes`: For geographic plots with *longitude* and *latitude* coordinates.
* `~proplot.axes.PolarAxes`: For polar plots with *radius* and *azimuth* coordinates.

See :ref:`X and Y axis settings` for details on working with `~proplot.axes.XYAxes` and
:ref:`Geographic and polar plots` for details on working with
`~proplot.axes.ProjAxes` and `~proplot.axes.PolarAxes`.

Figure and axes methods
=======================
The `~proplot.subplots.Figure` and `~proplot.axes.Axes` subclasses
include several *brand new* methods and add to the functionality of several *existing* methods.

* The new `~proplot.axes.Axes.format` method is used to fine-tune various axes settings.  Its behavior depends on whether the axes is an `~proplot.axes.XYAxes`, `~proplot.axes.PolarAxes`, or `~proplot.axes.ProjAxes`. Think of this as a dedicated `~matplotlib.artist.Artist.update` method for axes artists. See :ref:`Formatting subplots` and :ref:`Changing rc settings` for details.
* The `~proplot.subplots.Figure` `~proplot.subplots.Figure.colorbar` and `~proplot.subplots.Figure.legend` and `~proplot.axes.Axes` `~proplot.axes.Axes.colorbar` and `~proplot.axes.Axes.legend` commands are used to add colorbars and legends *inside* of subplots, along the *outside edge* of subplots, and along the *edge of the figure*. They considerably simplify the process of drawing colorbars and legends. See :ref:`Colorbars and legends` for details.
* ProPlot adds a huge variety of features for working with `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contour` plots, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolor` plots, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot` lines, `~proplot.axes.Axes.heatmap` plots, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.errorbar` bars, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar` plots, `~proplot.axes.Axes.area` plots, and `~proplot.axes.Axes.parametric` plots. See :ref:`1d plotting` and :ref:`2d plotting` for details.

Integration with other packages
===============================
ProPlot's features are integrated with the data containers
introduced by `xarray` and `pandas` and the
`cartopy` and `~mpl_toolkits.basemap` geographic
plotting toolkits.

* Axis labels, tick labels, titles, colorbar labels, and legend labels are automatically applied when you pass an `xarray.DataArray`, `pandas.DataFrame`, or `pandas.Series` object to any plotting command. This works just like the native `xarray.DataArray.plot` and `pandas.DataFrame.plot` methods. See :ref:`1d plotting` and :ref:`2d plotting` for details.
* The `~proplot.projs.Proj` function lets you make arbitrary grids of basemap `~mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap` and cartopy `~cartopy.crs.Projection` projections. It is used to interpret the `proj` keyword arg passed to `~proplot.subplots.subplots`. The resulting axes are instances of `~proplot.axes.ProjAxes` with `~proplot.axes.ProjAxes.format` methods that can be used to add geographic features and custom meridian and parallel gridlines. See :ref:`Geographic and polar plots` for details.

New functions and classes
=========================
ProPlot includes several useful *constructor functions*
and *subclasses* outside
of the `~proplot.subplots.Figure` and `~proplot.axes.Axes` subclasses.

* The `~proplot.styletools.Colormap` and `~proplot.styletools.Cycle` constructor functions can slice, merge, and modify colormaps and color cycles. See :ref:`Colormaps`, :ref:`Color cycles`, and :ref:`Colors and fonts` for details.
* The `~proplot.styletools.LinearSegmentedColormap` and  `~proplot.styletools.ListedColormap` subclasses replace the default matplotlib colormap classes and add several methods. The new `~proplot.styletools.PerceptuallyUniformColormap` class is used to make colormaps with perceptually uniform transitions. See :ref:`Colormaps` for details.
* The `~proplot.styletools.show_cmaps`, `~proplot.styletools.show_cycles`, `~proplot.styletools.show_colors`, `~proplot.styletools.show_fonts`, `~proplot.styletools.show_channels`, and `~~proplot.styletools.show_colorspaces` functions are used to visualize your color scheme and font options and inspect individual colormaps.
* The `~proplot.styletools.Norm` constructor function generates colormap normalizers from shorthand names. The new `~proplot.styletools.LinearSegmentedNorm` normalizer scales colors evenly w.r.t. index for arbitrarily spaced monotonic levels, and the new `~proplot.styletools.BinNorm` meta-normalizer is used to discretized colormap colors. See :ref:`2d plotting` for details.
* The `~proplot.axistools.Locator`, `~proplot.axistools.Formatter`, and `~proplot.axistools.Scale` constructor functions, used to generate class instances from variable input types. These are used to interpret keyword arguments passed to `~proplot.axes.Axes.format` and `~proplot.subplots.Figure.colorbar`. See :ref:`X and Y axis settings` for details.
* The `~proplot.rctools.rc` object, an instance of `~proplot.rctools.rc_configurator`, is used for modifying *individual* global settings, changing settings in *bulk*, and temporarily changing settings in *context blocks*. It also sets up the inline plotting backend, so that your inline figures look the same as your saved figures. See :ref:`Configuring proplot` for details.
