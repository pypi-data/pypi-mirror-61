    Optimize a geometry with respect to a solver.

        as :py:func:`berny.Berny`
    :param generator solver: unprimed generator that receives geometry as a
        2-tuple of a list of 2-tuples of the atom symbol and coordinate (as a
        3-tuple), and of a list of lattice vectors (or None if molecule), and
        yields the energy and gradients (as a N-by-3 matrix or (N+3)-by-3
        matrix in case of a crystal geometry)
    :param str trajectory: filename for the XYZ trajectory

    Returns the optimized geometry.

    The function is equivalent to::

        next(solver)

            optimizer.send((energy, gradients))
