        Automatically generates settings by taking different attribute subsets from a database

        This method assumes you have a pandas dataframe where each column represent a different
        attribute. Each row represents an instance to be classify. However, each attribute has a cost
        and thus the goal is to classify the instances with as small subset as possible. The cost
        is often shared between the attributes: e.g. if two attributes are calculated from the GPS
        stream, then having one or both has the same cost (the cost of having the GPS open). It may
        also be the case that using some sensor increases or decreases the cost of another sensor
        as they share resources when used.

        There are several ways of specifying which subsets to transform into settings.
        Use the one most convenient for the current domain. In all examples
        we will assume that data comes from different sensors (subsettings) and a setting is
        set of sensors that is in use. If the data (and costs) comes from different sources a
        similar logic applies.

        1. Set ``subsettings`` parameter as a list of sensors and ``subsetting_to_features`` as a
           dictionary that maps each sensor to attribute list (attributes calculated from that
           sensor)
        2. Set ``feature_groups`` as a list of lists. Each list represents features that should all be
           included or excluded in any attribute subset used (e.g. they come from the same sensor).
           Set ``n`` as the number of ``feature_groups``.
        3. Set ``n`` as the number of sensors, set ``setting_fn_features`` as a function that takes
           a binary string of length ``n`` and outputs a list of attributes. Character i in
           binary string represents whether i-th sensor is active.

        This method is not a substitute for attribute selection.

        Generates different CS-DTs from data around different contexts.

        When generating these cost-sensitive decision trees, only data from one contexts
        (and instances around it) are taken.  This should create a tree that is good at recognizing
        that context and contexts to which it frequently transitions to. This method also tries
        different weights, same as the :func:`~EnergyOptimizer.add_csdt_weighted` method.
        Generated CS-DT get added to the list of possible settings.

        :param cs_tree: the base cost-sensitive tree object
                        (:class:`eecr.cstree.CostSensitiveTree`) to use for generation of
                        its variants
        :param x1: a pandas dataframe of attributes to be used as the training set
        :param y1: a pandas series of labels for the instances in ``x1``
        :param x2: a pandas dataframe of attributes to be used as the testing set
        :param y2: a pandas series of labels for the instances in ``x2``
        :param x_p: (optional) a pandas dataframe of attributes to be used as the pruning set
        :param y_p: (optional) a pandas series of labels for the instances in ``x_p``
        :param buffer_range: specifies how many instances to take after a contexts transitions
        :param test_fn: a function used for measuring energy while testing a CS-DT, if it need to be
                        different than the one used for training
        :param verbose: if true, the function prints out the current progress
        :param weights_range: a tuple with two elements, representing the minimum and maximum weight
                              to be used. Trees
                              will use ``n_tree`` different weights equidistantly sampled between
                              these two extreme values. Sensible weight range must be determined
                              manually, but as a heuristic, it is usually inversely proportional to
                              the energy costs. For example if energy costs are all >1 then weights
                              should all be <1.
        :param energy_range: An alternative to the ``weights_range`` parameter, setting this to x
                             is equivalent to setting ``weights_range`` to 1/n
        :param n_tree: number of different CS-DT to be generated
        :param name: None or relative path to a file. If latter, the generated settings will be saved
        :param cstree_energy: Generate accurate energy sequences that can be used to increase the
                              accuracy of the :func:`~EnergyOptimizer.sca_real`. It makes this
                              function much slower
        :return: the set of generated CS-DTs
