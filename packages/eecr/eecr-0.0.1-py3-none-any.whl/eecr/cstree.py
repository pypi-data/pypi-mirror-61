        :param tree_type: there are three types of trees that can be generated: "default", "pruned"
                          and "batched". The pruned version prunes the tree using a dedicated pruning
                          set after tree generation. "batched" version tries to place attributes that
                          share energy costs as close together as possible. This results in a longer
                          train time, but usually slightly better performance
        :param min_samples: the minimum number of samples in a non-leaf node
        :param extension: if this is set as >0 the tree building process will sometimes expand nodes
                          even if energy-inefficient in anticipation that the decision will pay off
                          later in the tree. It prunes these branches if the anticipation proves to be
                          wrong. This results in a longer
                          train time, but usually slightly better performance (in practice
                          extension=1 proved best)
        :param default: context to be classified in case of an empty tree
        :param weight: weight of the energy cost when compared to the misclassification cost
