Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This small library has a method to create a MIME Multipart email object
        with HTML and Text content to be able to send it by e-mail.
        
        This allows you to prepare an HTML content (with a templating language)
        and forget about the text representation of the HTML; just import the
        method and call it with the HTML content and the e-mail headers (to, cc,
        subject, ...)
        
        This is the signature of the method::
        
          def create_html_mail(subject, html, text=None, from_addr=None, to_addr=None,
                             cc_addrs=[], headers=None, encoding='UTF-8'):
