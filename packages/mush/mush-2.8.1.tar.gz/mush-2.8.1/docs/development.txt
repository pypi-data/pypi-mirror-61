This package is developed using continuous integration which can be
found here:

https://circleci.com/gh/Simplistix/mush

The latest development version of the documentation can be found here:

http://mush.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

If you wish to contribute to this project, then you should fork the
repository found here:

Once that has been done and you have a checkout, you can follow these
instructions to perform various development tasks:

Setting up a virtualenv
-----------------------

The recommended way to set up a development environment is to turn
your checkout into a virtualenv and then install the package in
editable form as follows::

  $ virtualenv .
  $ bin/pip install -U -e .[test,build]

Running the tests
-----------------

Once you have a buildout, the tests can be run as follows::

  $ bin/pytest

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The Sphinx documentation is built by doing the following from the
directory containing setup.py::

  $ cd docs
  $ make html

Making a release
----------------

To make a release, just update the version in ``setup.py``,
update the change log and push to https://github.com/Simplistix/mush
and Carthorse should take care of the rest.
