Description: ShopKeepr:
        
        An automated requirements manager for python projects.
        
        
        
        Ever felt that updating the requirements.xt file is a bit too tedious? or too bloated with a lot of dependencies? Same. A lot of times it happens that after uninstalling a package from your project, there are dangling dependencies still left.
        
        ShopKeepr takes care of it all for you by maintaining a state of all packages and dependencies installed for the project you're working on, removing all unused dependencies when you uninstall a package and update the requirements.txt file automatically whenever you make a change to the state of installed packages for your projects in your virtual environment.
        
        
        
        Installation Instructions:
        
        ```
        pip3 install shopkeepr
        ```
        
        
        
        Usage Instructions:
        
        ```
        keepr <command> <package list>
        ```
        
        
        
        Commands:
        
        * install - Install Packages
        * uninstall - Uninstall Packages and dependencies
        * update - Update an existing package
        * help - Display Help information
        * credits - List author credits
        
        
        
        Example:
        
        ```
        keepr install django==2.2 pymongo==1.2
        ```
        
        
        
        **Note:** 
         
        * The application currently supports 'venv' to manage the virtual environment for the project you're working on.     
        
        * The application makes use of a sqlite database named 'packages.db' under each project. You'd need to add that to your .gitignore file to avoid pushing it to your repo.
