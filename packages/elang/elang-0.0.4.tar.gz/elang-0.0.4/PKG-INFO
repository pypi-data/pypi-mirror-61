Description: # Education Toolkit for Bahasa Indonesia NLP
        
        > This repository is the trimmed down version of [Elangdev](https://github.com/onlyphantom/elangdev). It is maintained for accuracy purposes. For example code, experimental / in-development features and tutorial materials, use [Elangdev](https://github.com/onlyphantom/elangdev) instead. 
        
        Elang is an acronym that combines the phrases **Education (E)** and **Language Understanding (Lang)**. It is an education-centric toolkit to demonstrate the ideas behind many Natural Language Processing strategies commercially used today.

        ## Elang
        Elang also means "eagle" in Bahasa Indonesia, and the _elang Jawa_ (Javan hawk-eagle) is the national bird of Indonesia, more commonly referred to as Garuda. 
        
        The package provides a collection of utility functions and tools that interface with `gensim` and `scikit-learn`, as well as curated negative lists for Bahasa Indonesia (kata kasar / vulgar words, _stopwords_ etc) and useful preprocesisng functions.
        
        # Quick Demo
        
        Install `elang`:
        ```bash
        pip install elang
        ```
        
        Performing word embeddings in **4 lines of code** gets you a visualization:
        ```py
        from elang.plot.utils import plot2d
        from gensim.models import Word2Vec
        
        model = Word2Vec.load("path.to.model")
        plot2d(model)
        # output:
        ```

        It even looks like a soaring eagle with its outstretched wings!
