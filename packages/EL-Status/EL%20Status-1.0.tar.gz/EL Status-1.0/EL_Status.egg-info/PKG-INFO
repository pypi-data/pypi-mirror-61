        ## Introduction ##
        
        We wanna achieve a little tidiness when it comes to a way of reporting our status such as:
        * working remotely
        * off
        * sick-leave
        
        It's time to goodbye ~~one-hundred emails per day from zdalnie@elpassion.pl.
        
        Furthermore, we want to find a place for people who:
        * takes a rest on the beach #wakacje
        
        or
        
        * gets unexpected news about the arrival of the courier with the package #kurier.
        
        Turning to technology: Python & iOS. No worries! Android will be later.
        
        Anyone from the UI & UX department is truly welcome.
        
        ## Technologies ##
        
        - Python
        - Flask
