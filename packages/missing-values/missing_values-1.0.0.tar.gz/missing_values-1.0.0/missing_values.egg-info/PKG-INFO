        # missing_values
        
        missing_values is a Python package for handling missing values from a dataset.
        
        ## Missing values
        
        Hereâ€™s some typical reasons why data is missing:
        User forgot to fill in a field.
        Data was lost while transferring manually from a legacy database.
        There was a programming error.
        Users chose not to fill out a field tied to their beliefs about how the results would be used or interpreted.
        As you can see, some of these sources are just simple random mistakes. Other times, there can be a deeper reason why data is missing.
        Itâ€™s important to understand these different types of missing data from a statistics point of view. The type of missing data will influence how you deal with filling in the missing values.
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will help you to install and use this package for general use. 
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        Your csv file should not have categorical data
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install missing_values.
        
        ```bash
        pip install missing_values
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        You can import it either in Python IDLE or run directly through command prompt
        
        ### For Command Prompt
        
        If you want to use this package on "data.csv" file. You need to change the directory where "data.csv" is stored then pass the name of csv file ("data.csv") as an input,your new csv file without missing values will be stored as "MissingValuesRemovedata.csv"
        
        ```bash
        missing_values data.csv 
        ```
        
        
        ### For Python IDLE
        
        ```python
        from missing_values.missing import missing_values
        missing_values(file1)
        
        #file1 is name of your csv file on which you will perform operation
        
        ```
