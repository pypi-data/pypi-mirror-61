        Note
        ----
            - Make sure to pre-install ``datestamp`` before running ``python3 setup.py ...``. This is only required for publishers, for users it will be auto installed through ``setup_requires=['datestamp']``
            - New version stamp is only generated when you are ready to publish your project by
              ``python3 setup.py sdist`` or current version date is used.
            - When new date is generated at ``setup(version=stamp(...))`` it also replaces ``__version__`` line with ``__version__ = '2020.2.9'`` in ``__init__.py`` file.
            - Works for One-Off script file as well like ``datestamp.py`` package itself.
            - If for some reason you can't pre-install ``datestamp`` you can include ``datestamp.py`` file besides your ``setup.py`` and import it that way. Also don't forget to ``include datestamp.py`` in ``MANIFEST.in`` if you know the user installing your package does not have access t
