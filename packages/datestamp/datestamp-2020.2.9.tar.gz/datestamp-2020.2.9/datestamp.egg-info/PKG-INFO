        Install, update & uninstall (Alpha)
        -----------------------------------
        
        Use `pip`_ to install, upgrade & uninstall:
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
            pip install datestamp
        
            pip install --upgrade datestamp
        
            pip uninstall datestamp
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ./setup.py
        
        .. code-block:: python
            
            from datestamp import stamp
        
            setup(...,
                  setup_requires=['datestamp'],
                  version=stamp('package_name'),
                  ...)
        
        
        Note
        ----
            - New version stamp is only generated when you are ready to publish your project by
              ``python3 setup.py sdist`` or current version date is used.
            - When new date is generated at ``setup(version=stamp(...))`` it also replaces ``__version__`` line with ``__version__ = '2020.2.9'`` in ``__init__.py`` file.
            - Works for One-Off script file as well like ``datestamp`` package itself.
