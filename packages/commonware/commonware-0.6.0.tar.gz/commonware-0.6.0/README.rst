Commonware is a collection of small but useful tools for Django.

They seemed too small to be worth their own packages, but we also wanted
to share them. So here they are.

Note
====

As of version 0.6.0 the minimum supported Python version is 3.6 and the minimum Django is 2.2.
If you need support for older versions you should use version 0.5.0.
