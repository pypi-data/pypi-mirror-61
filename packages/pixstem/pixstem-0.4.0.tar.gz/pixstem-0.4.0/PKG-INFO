        Python library for analysing pixelated scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) datasets.
        Pixelated STEM is using a 2D detector to image the convergent beam electron pattern generated by the electron beam after passing through a material.
        
        The library has implemented several common functions used with these types of datasets, like radial integration and center of mass.
        These are implemented as HyperSpy-type signals, where these new signals both inherit the old methods and add many new ones.
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        The easiest way is installing using with pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install pixstem
        ```
        
        Using
        -----
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import pixstem.api as ps
        s = ps.PixelatedSTEM(np.random.random(size=(5, 5, 10, 10)))
        s_r = s.radial_integration()
        ```
