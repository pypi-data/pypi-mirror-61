        ---------  
        
        Welcome to the brand new DVH Analytics (DVHA), rewritten as a native OS application with wxPython. The 
        previous web-based version can be found [here](https://github.com/cutright/DVH-Analytics-Bokeh) but is no longer being 
        developed.

        DVHA Executables
        ---------
        
        Executable versions of DVHA can be found [here](https://github.com/cutright/DVH-Analytics/releases). 
        Please keep in mind this software is still in beta. If you have issues, compiling from source may be more informative. 
        
        
        Admin Rights No Longer Needed
        ---------
        As of v0.6.7, DVHA supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL.  
          
        SQLite:  
        * No admin rights needed on your computer
        * No need to figure out how to make user logins and databases in SQL
        * Easier to share your database - just zip (and encrypt), send to colleague  
          
        PostgreSQL:  
        * Supports multiple instances of DVHA accessing the same database at once
        * Database may be housed remotely (just need the accessible IP address)
        * Supports user login and password
        
        Additional SQLite vs PostgreSQL information can be found [here](https://tableplus.com/blog/2018/08/sqlite-vs-postgresql-which-database-to-use-and-why.html).
        
        
        About
        ---------
        DVH Analytics is a software application to help radiation oncology departments build an in-house database of treatment 
        planning data for the purpose of historical comparisons and statistical analysis.
        
        The application builds a SQL database of DVHs and various planning parameters from DICOM files 
        (i.e., Plan, Structure, Dose). Since the data is extracted directly from DICOM files, we intend
        to accommodate an array of treatment planning system vendors.

        In addition to viewing DVH data, this software provides methods to:
        
        - download queried data
        - create time-series plots of various planning and dosimetric variables
        - calculate correlations
        - generate multi-variable linear and machine learning regressions.
        - additional screenshots available [here](https://github.com/cutright/DVH-Analytics/issues/9)
        
        
        The code is built upon these core libraries:
        * [wxPython Phoenix](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix) - Build a native GUI on Windows, Mac, or Unix systems
        * [Pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) - Read, modify and write DICOM files with python code
        * [dicompyler-core](https://github.com/dicompyler/dicompyler-core) - Extensible radiation therapy research platform and viewer for DICOM and DICOM RT
        * [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) - Interactive Web Plotting for Python
        * [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) - Machine Learning in Python
        
        
        Installation
        ---------
        To install via pip:
        ```
        pip install dvha
        ```
        If you've installed via pip or setup.py, launch from your terminal with:
        ```
        dvha
        ```
        If you've cloned the project, but did not run the setup.py installer, launch DVHA with:
        ```
        python dvha_app.py
        ```
        See our [installation notes](https://github.com/cutright/DVH-Analytics/blob/master/install_notes.md) for potential 
        Shapely install issues on MS Windows and help setting up a PostgreSQL database if it is preferred over SQLite3.
