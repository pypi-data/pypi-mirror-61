Fluddy
===========================

*fluddy* is an effective, lightweight and dependency-free command-line utility for managing, launching, updating and creating Flask Apps.

Description
------------

Flask is fast becoming the most popular web development framework for Python. Developers will typically manage multiple Flask apps individually where each app will rely on its own virtual environment - this can become tedius when launching and updating multiple Flask Apps in development. 

Flask Buddy (fluddy) allows developers to launch and update their individual Flask Apps through a simple Command-Line Interface. CLI functionality also allows developers to create a launchable 'Hello from Fluddy' Flask App and to add previously created Flask Apps to fluddy for painless launches and updates.
