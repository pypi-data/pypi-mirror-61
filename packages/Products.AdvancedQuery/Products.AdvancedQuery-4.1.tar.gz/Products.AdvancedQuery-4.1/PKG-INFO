Description: ``AdvancedQuery`` is a Zope product extending Zope's search
        engine ``ZCatalog`` with the following key features:
        
         * flexible and intuitive construction of query objects
        
         * support for arbitrary "and", "or" and "not" combinations of queries
        
         * flexible multi-level sort support; incremental sorting
        
         * ranking support
        
         * new elementary searches (such as "glob" and "regexp" searches)
        
         * support for incremental filtering
        
         * functional and/or efficiency gains via Zope "(subscription) adapter"s
           for indexes
        
         * optional integration with
           `dm.incrementalsearch`__, 
           a low level incremental search engine
           aiming to reduce the number of ZODB loads for searching

        Installation
        ============
        
        The package can be ``pip`` installed.
        
        The use of this package requires that its ``configure.zcml`` is
        "executed" during startup (usually, this happens automatically).
        
        In order to use this package in Plone, the companion package
        ``dm.plone.advancedquery`` must be installed and its ``configure.zcml``
        "executed" during startup.
        
        
        Partial history
        ===============
        
        4.1
          Extensions/optimizations for ``ZCTextIndex`` with ``Okapi``-Index.
        
        4.0
          Python 3/Zope 4 compatibility
        
          Drop support for Zope2 (due to significant differences
          between the ``Products.ZCatalog`` versions for
          Zope2 and Zope 4+, respectively).
        
          Supports Plone 5.2+ via the companion package ``dm.plone.advancedquery``.
        
          Integration of indexes and ``dm.incrementalsearch`` now customizable
          via (subscription) adapters -- independence of ``Products.ManagableIndex``
          and ``dm.incrementalsearch``.
        
        
        3.0.4
          Adapt to cosmetic modifications in ``Products.CMFCore==2.3.0``.
          
        3.0.3
          use the newer index sorting API (``documentToKeyMap``) if
          the older API (``keyForDocument``) is missing or obviously broken.
        
          The fix has been introduced for the ``nogopip`` index used in Plone 4.1.
          Unfortunately, this index version not only defines a broken
          ``keyForDocument`` but in addition uses call frame inspection targeted
          at ``ZCatalog`` sorting which fails when called by ``AdvancedQuery``,
          see https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11637.
          Until this problem is resolved, you cannot use a ``nogopip`` index as
          sort index for ``AdvancedQuery``.
          
        3.0.2
          Zope 2.13 compatibility
        
        3.0.1
          fix test suite for Zope 2.12 by dropping ``ZopeTestCase.framework`` support.
          This implies that the test suite can now only be executed via the Zope
          test runner.
