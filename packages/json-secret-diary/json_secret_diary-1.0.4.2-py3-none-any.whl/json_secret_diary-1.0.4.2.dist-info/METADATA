# Secret Diary
My own project to manage my daily diary, works with only **Python 3**

# How it works
The entire diary is based only on JSON text, everything is done with JSON.
Diary has 'public' infos and 'secret' infos, the secret part is encrypted with AES algorithm.

The public part is called 'summary', this will be usefull to help you to know what that page of diary talk about or specific infos.

No connection to internet required, new diary will be created if username is not recognized (obviously with a prompt to allow or deny).

Once you wrote you can't edit text (both public and private) but you can write without limits.

Password of your diary is stored in the same JSON file, the name is yout username setted at first start.

# How to install

This code can be installed with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/json-secret-diary/), if you have pip installed execute the pip command to install new package `pip install json_secret_diary`

# Example of usage

You have 2 ways to use my package from command-line, simply write `json_secret_diary` and creation start!

You can also use with your python project, here an example:

```python
import json_secret_diary

my_username = 'example'
my_password = 'example_pw'

# Create Diary object
my_diary = json_secret_diary.Diary(my_username, my_password)

# Access to diary, if exist
# if not exist create new one if authorized
my_diary.access()
```
