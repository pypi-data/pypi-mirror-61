        <!-- Here pymem should be replaced with your library's name on PyPI  -->

        The template library is [`pymem`](https://github.com/scailfin/PyMEM/search?q=pymem&unscoped_q=pymem) to make it clear what is needed for replacement
        
        ## Setting up the template for your library
        
        1. Edit `setup.py` to reflect all of your library's needs and requirements
        2. Edit the paths to badges in the `README` to match your library's locations
           - Change `libame` to your library's name
           - Change `scailfin` to your username or org name on GitHub
           - Change `PyMEM` to your project name on GitHub (probably the same as the library name)
        3. Replace the rest of the `README` contents with your information
        4. Run `git grep "pymem"` to make sure that you have changed all instances of `libame` (it is easy to miss the dotfiles)
        5. Setup accounts with [Codecov](https://codecov.io/), [LGTM](https://lgtm.com/), and [CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/)
           - Also add the [Codecov](https://github.com/marketplace/codecov) and [LGTM](https://github.com/marketplace/lgtm) GitHub marketplace apps
        6. Generate a Codecov token and add it to your [GitHub repo's secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#contexts) with name `CODECOV_TOKEN`
        
        ## Controlling the version number with bumpversion
        
        When you want to increment the version number for a new release use [`bumpversion`](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion) to do it correctly across the whole library.
        For example, to increment to a new patch release you would simply run
        
        ```
        bumpversion patch
        ```
        
        which given the [`.bumpversion.cfg`](https://github.com/scailfin/PyMEM/blob/master/.bumpversion.cfg) makes a new commit that increments the release version by one patch release.
