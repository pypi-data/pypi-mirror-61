## Installation

This package is available via PyPi.

```
$ python3 -m pip install chs
```

## Usage

To play against the default level 1 (easiest) version of the Stockfish engine, just run `chs` command.

### How to start playing

```
$ chs
```

You can also specify the level of the engine if you want to tweak the difficulty.

```
$ chs level=8
```

### How to play

There are a few things you can do while playing:

* Make moves using valid alegraic notation (e.g. `Nf3`, `e4`, etc.).
* Take back your last move by playing `back` instead of a valid move.
* Get a hint from the engine by playing `hint` instead of a valid move.
