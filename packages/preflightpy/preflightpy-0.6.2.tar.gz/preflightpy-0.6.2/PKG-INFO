        Python module for **S**imulation and **O**ptimization of **R**ocket **T**rajectories, [**SORT**](https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/140648main_ESAS_17a.pdf#page=19) for short.
        - Altitude prediction
        - State prediction
        - Flight trajectory optimization
        - Flight plan optimization
        
        ## Quick Start :vertical_traffic_light:
        
        Before we get started, please note that PreflightPy was built with **Python 3.x** in mind and might not be compatible with older versions.
        
        ### Installation
        
        Getting yourself your very own copy of this module is super simple!
        You can get Preflight from pip using your terminal via the following command:
        
          ```bash
          pip install preflight
          ```
        
        That's it you're set!
        
        ### Usage
        
        Here's an example of typical usage of this package:
        
          ```python
          # Importing the module
          import preflightpy as pre
        
          # The 'Parameters' class collects info about the rocket and environmental conditions etc. from the input file.
          params = pre.Parameters("path/to/input/file.json")  
        
          #  The 'Environment' takes care of computing conditions (e.g. atmosphere, gravity) at various altitudes.
          env = pre.Environment(p.env_variables)
        
          # Specify the burn time of your engine in seconds.
          burn_time = 10
        
          # The 'System', the core of this module, it takes care of the main simulation and output.
          s = pre.System(params, env, 10)  
        
          s.launch()  # Blast off! Launches the simulation.
        
          # The results are outputted in .csv and .log formats and are located in the output folder specified by input file
          ```
        
        The following is the format you'll have to use in your `.json` input files:
        
          ```json
          {
            "Engine" : {
              "Specific Impulse (s)" : 318,  
              "Thrust (N)" : 500  
            },
            "Fuel" : {
              "Oxidizer/Fuel Mixture Ratio" : 15,  
              "Fuel Reserve (%)" : 5  
            },
            "Mass" : {
              "Dry Mass (kg)" : 10  
            },
            "Aerodynamics" : {

              "Cross-section (m2)" : 0.0255364  
            },
            "Environment" : {
              "Elevation (m)" : 113,
              "Simulation step (s)" : 0.01,
              "Standard gravity (m/s2)" : 9.80665,
              "Air molar mass (kg/mol)" : 0.02896968,
              "Gas constant (J/(K.mol))" : 8.314462618,
              "Air heat capacity ratio" : 1.4,
              "Standard Atmospheric pressure @SL (Pa)" : 101325
            },
            "Output" : {
              "Log File Path" : "Flight.log",  
              "CSV File Path" : "Flight.csv"  
            }
          }
          ```
