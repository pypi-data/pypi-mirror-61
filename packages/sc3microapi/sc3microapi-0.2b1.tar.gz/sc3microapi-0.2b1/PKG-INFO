        Micro web service for SeisComP3 systems
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        In order to integrate systems running SeisComP3 with other systems or tools
        is important to expose at least some basic information related to the system
        in operation. For instance, which networks and stations are present in the
        inventory with some attributes that are not visible through the FDSN Station-WS.
        
        Some other internal data, like access control lists, are important for other
        systems providing data. Thus, the permissions can be managed in SC3 and used in
        many other places, offering the operator a single management point.
