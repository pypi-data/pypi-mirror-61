Description: # sopel-inclusivity
        
        Sopel Inclusive Language suggests better wordings when people don't use
        inclusive language. It's inspired by [this blog
        post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/12/hacking-inclusion-by-customizing-a-slack-bot/)
        from 18F, who've added a similar feature to their Slack rooms. It only deals
        with use of the word "guys" for now, but if there is any other language it
        could cover, PRs are welcome.
