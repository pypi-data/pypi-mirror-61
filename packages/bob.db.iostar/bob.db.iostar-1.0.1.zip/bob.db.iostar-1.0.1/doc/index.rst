IOSTAR Retinal Vessel Segmentation Dataset
===========================================
This package is part of the signal-processing and machine learning toolbox Bob_. It provides an interface for the `IOSTAR Dataset`_. This package does
not contain the original data files, which need to be obtained through the link above.

The IOSTAR vessel segmentation dataset includes 30 images with a resolution of 1024 Ã— 1024 pixels. 
All the vessels in this dataset are annotated by a group of experts working in the field of retinal image analysis. 
Additionally the dataset includes annotations for the optic disc and the artery/vein ratio.
