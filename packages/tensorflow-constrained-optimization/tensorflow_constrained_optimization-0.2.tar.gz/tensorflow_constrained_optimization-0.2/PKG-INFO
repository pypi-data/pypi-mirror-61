Description: *TensorFlow Constrained Optimization* (TFCO) is a library for optimizing
        inequality-constrained problems in TensorFlow.
        
        In the most general case, both the objective function and the constraints are
        represented as `Tensor`s, giving users the maximum amount of flexibility in
        specifying their optimization problems. Constructing these `Tensor`s can be
        cumbersome, so we also provide helper functions to make it easy to construct
        constrained optimization problems based on *rates*, i.e. proportions of the
        training data on which some event occurs (e.g. the error rate, true positive
        rate, recall, etc).
