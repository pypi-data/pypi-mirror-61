# FastAPI Common Framework

## Version: 0.2.1

This is the common API framework used by the CSIRO geoanalytics software team. Not currently designed for use outside of the CSIRO geoanalytics team.

Code and concepts borrow heavily from [FastAPI Contrib](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi-contrib/) I suggest you check them out if you are looking for a user friendly open source FastAPI Utility framework.
