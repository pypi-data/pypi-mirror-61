#    You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the
#    blank line above.  The text can keep going on for a long time, flowing
#    across
#    *many* lines. There may be stuff such as $a = b$ and `literals`.
#
#    You can have a line break within the list.
#
#    Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.
