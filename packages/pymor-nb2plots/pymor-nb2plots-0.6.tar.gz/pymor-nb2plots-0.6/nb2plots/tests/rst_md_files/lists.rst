   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the
   blank line above.  The text can keep going on for a long time, flowing
   across
   *many* lines. There may be stuff such as :math:`a = b` and ``literals``.

   You can have a line break within the list.

   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.
