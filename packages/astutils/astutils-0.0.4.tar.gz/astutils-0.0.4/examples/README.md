This example shows how `astutils` can be used to write a package that
includes a parser, whose tables are created and copied during installation.

Other examples of parsers that use `astutils` are contained in the modules:

- [`dd._parser`](https://github.com/johnyf/dd/blob/master/dd/_parser.py)
- [`omega.logic.ast`](https://github.com/johnyf/omega/blob/master/omega/logic/ast.py)
- [`omega.logic.lexyacc`](https://github.com/johnyf/omega/blob/master/omega/logic/lexyacc.py)
- [`omega.symbolic.bdd`](https://github.com/johnyf/omega/blob/master/omega/symbolic/bdd.py)
