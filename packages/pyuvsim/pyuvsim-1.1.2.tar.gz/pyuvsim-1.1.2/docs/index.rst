pyuvsim is a comprehensive simulation package for radio interferometers
in python.

A number of analysis tools are available to simulate the output of a
radio interferometer (CASA, OSCAR, FHD, PRISim, et al), however each
makes numerical approximations to enable speed ups. The pyuvsim goal is
to provide a simulated instrument output which emphasizes accuracy and
extensibility.

Motivation and Approach
=======================

The two primary pyuvsim goals are interferometer simulation accuracy at
the level of precision necessary for 21cm cosmology science. Key
elements of this approach include:

1. High level of test coverage including accuracy (design goal is 97%).
2. Include analytic tests in unittests.
3. Comparison with external simulations.
4. Design for scalability across many cpus.

Installation
============

-  For simple installation, the latest stable version is available via
   pip (``pip install pyuvsim``)
-  To install the development version: Clone the repository using
   ``git clone https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyuvsim``,
   navigate into the pyuvsim directory and run ``pip install .``
-  pyuvsim is mainly intended to run on clusters running the linux
   operating system

Dependencies
------------

-  ``numpy``, ``astropy``, ``scipy``, ``mpi4py``, ``pyyaml``, ``six``,
   ``pyuvdata``
-  optionally ``line_profiler`` if you want to do profiling (support for
   profiling is built in)

Inputs
======

A simulation requires sets of times, frequencies, source positions and
brightnesses, antenna positions, and direction-dependent primary beam
responses. pyuvsim specifies times, frequencies, and array configuration
via a UVData object (from the pyuvdata package), source positions and
brightnesses via Source objects, and primary beams either through UVBeam
or AnalyticBeam objects.

-  All sources are treated as point sources, with flux specified in
   Stokes parameters and position in right ascension / declination in
   the International Celestial Reference Frame (equivalently, in J2000
   epoch).
-  Primary beams are specified as full electric field components, and
   are interpolated in angle and frequency. This allows for an exact
   Jones matrix to be constructed for each desired source position.
-  Multiple beam models may be used throughout the array, allowing for
   more complex instrument responses to be modeled.

These input objects may be made from a data file or from a set of
``yaml`` configuration files. See `Running a
simulation <https://pyuvsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`__.

Quick start guide
=================

Example ``obsparam`` configuration files may be found in the
``reference_simulations`` directory.

1. Install from github or pip.
2. Run off of a parameter file with 20 MPI ranks:

::

   mpirun -n 20 python run_param_pyuvsim.py reference_simulations/obsparam_1.1.yaml

Documentation
=============

Documentation on how to run simulations and developer API documentation
is hosted on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyuvsim.readthedocs.io>`__.

How to contribute
=================

Contributions to this package to add new features or address any of the
issues in the `issue
log <https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyuvsim/issues>`__
are very welcome. Please submit improvements as pull requests against
the repo after verifying that the existing tests pass and any new code
is well covered by unit tests.

Bug reports or feature requests are also very welcome, please add them
to the issue log after verifying that the issue does not already exist.
Comments on existing issues are also welcome.

Versioning Approach
===================

We use a ``generation.major.minor`` format.

-  Generation - Release combining multiple new physical effects and or
   major computational improvements. Testing: Backed by unittests,
   internal model validation, and significant external comparison.
-  Major - Adds new physical effect or major computational improvement.
   Small number of improvements with each release. Testing: Backed by
   unittests, internal model validation and limited external comparison.
-  Minor - Bug fixes and small improvements not expected to change
   physical model. Testing: Backed by unittests

Some helpful definitions
------------------------

-  **Physical effects**: things like polarization effects, noise,
   ionospheric modeling, or nonterrestrial observing positions.
-  **Major computational improvement**: Support for new catalog types
   (e.g, diffuse maps), new analysis tools, changes to parallelization
   scheme
-  **Small improvements**: Better documentation or example code, outer
   framework redesign.
