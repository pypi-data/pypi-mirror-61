pyuvsim is a comprehensive simulation package for radio interferometers in python.

A number of analysis tools are available to simulate the output of a radio
interferometer (CASA, OSKAR, FHD, PRISim, et al), however each makes numerical
approximations to enable speed ups. pyuvsim's goal is to provide a simulated
instrument output which emphasizes accuracy and extensibility, and can represent the most
general simulator design.

A comparison to other simulators may be found at [ReadTheDocs](https://pyuvsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparison.html).

## Motivation and Approach
pyuvsim's two primary goals are interferometer simulation accuracy at the level of
precision necessary for 21cm cosmology science, and maximum flexibility in use cases.
Key elements of this approach include:

1. High level of test coverage including accuracy (design goal is 97%).
2. Include analytic tests in unittests.
3. Comparison with external simulations.
4. Design for scalability across many cpus.
5. Fully-polarized instrument response, floating-point source position accuracy,
   full-sky field of view, and exact antenna positions.
6. Support for varied beam models across the array.
7. Defining a clear, user-friendly standard for simulation design.

## Installation
A user-installation is achieved simply with `pip install pyuvsim`, or to get the
bleeding-edge: `pip install https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyuvsim`.
This will install all dependencies.

By default, `mpi` capabilities are not enabled -- many of the utilities provided in
`pyuvsim` do not require it. To use the simulator within `pyuvsim`, you should install
`pyuvsim` with  `pip install pyuvsim[sim]`.

There are a few more optional dependencies for `pyuvsim` which enable some features,
such as `line_profiler` to use the built-in profiling, and `h5py` to write to HDF5
file format. If you would like these tools as well as the full simulator, install
`pyuvsim` with `pip install pyuvsim[all]`

If you wish to manage dependencies manually, or are developing `pyuvsim` yourself, read
on.

Note that `pyuvsim` is intended to run on clusters running the linux operating system.


### Dependencies
If you are using `conda` to manage your environment, you may wish to install the
following before installing `pyuvsim`:

    conda install -c conda-forge "numpy>=1.15" "astropy>=3.0" "scipy>1.0.1" "mpi4py>=3.0.0" "pyyaml>=5.1" "pyuvdata>=1.3.7"

### Developing
If you are developing `pyuvsim`, it is preferred that you do so in a fresh `conda`
environment. The following commands will install all relevant development packages:

    $ git clone https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyuvsim.git
    $ cd pyuvsim
    $ conda create -n pyuvsim python=3
    $ conda activate pyuvsim
    $ conda env update -n pyuvsim -f environment.yml
    $ pip install -e .

This will install extra dependencies required for testing/development as well as the
standard ones.

The second-to-last line may also be replaced by `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you
do not care about using `conda`.


## Inputs

A simulation requires sets of times, frequencies, source positions and brightnesses, antenna positions, and direction-dependent primary beam responses. pyuvsim specifies times, frequencies, and array configuration via a UVData object (from the pyuvdata package), source positions and brightnesses via Source objects, and primary beams either through UVBeam or AnalyticBeam objects.

* All sources are treated as point sources, with flux specified in Stokes parameters and position in right ascension / declination in the International Celestial Reference Frame (equivalently, in J2000 epoch).
* Primary beams are specified as full electric field components, and are interpolated in angle and frequency. This allows for an exact Jones matrix to be constructed for each desired source position.
* Multiple beam models may be used throughout the array, allowing for more complex instrument responses to be modeled.

These input objects may be made from a data file or from a set of `yaml` configuration files. See [Running a simulation](https://pyuvsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

## Outputs

Data from a simulation run are written out to a file in any format accessible with `pyuvdata`. This includes:

* uvfits
* MIRIAD
* uvh5

When read into a UVData object, the `history` string will contain information on the pyuvsim and pyuvdata versions used for that run (including the latest git hash, if available), and details on the catalog used.

## Quick start guide
Example `obsparam` configuration files may be found in the `reference_simulations` directory.

1. Install from github or pip.
2. Run off of a parameter file with 20 MPI ranks:
```
mpirun -n 20 run_param_pyuvsim.py reference_simulations/obsparam_1.1.yaml
```

## Documentation
Documentation on how to run simulations and developer API documentation is hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://pyuvsim.readthedocs.io).

## Testing

`pyuvsim` uses the `pytest` package for unit testing. If you've cloned the source into a directory `pyuvsim/`, you may verify it as follows:

1. Install `pytest` from anaconda or pip.
2. Run the pytest from `pyuvsim/`
```
pytest
```
You can alternatively run ```python -m pytest pyuvsim``` or ```python setup.py test```.
You will need to have all dependencies installed.

## Where to find Support

Please feel free to submit new issues to the [issue log](https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyuvsim/issues) to request new features, document new bugs, or ask questions.

## How to contribute
Contributions to this package to add new features or address any of the
issues in the [issue log](https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyuvsim/issues) are very welcome.
Please submit improvements as pull requests against the repo after verifying that
the existing tests pass and any new code is well covered by unit tests.

Bug reports or feature requests are also very welcome, please add them to the
issue log after verifying that the issue does not already exist.
Comments on existing issues are also welcome.

## Versioning Approach
We use a `generation.major.minor` format.

* Generation - Release combining multiple new physical effects and or major computational improvements.
Testing: Backed by unittests, internal model validation, and significant external comparison.
* Major - Adds new physical effect or major computational improvement. Small number of improvements with each release.
Testing: Backed by unittests, internal model validation and limited external comparison.
* Minor - Bug fixes and small improvements not expected to change physical model.
Testing: Backed by unittests

### Some helpful definitions
* __Physical effects__: things like polarization effects, noise, ionospheric modeling, or nonterrestrial observing positions.
* __Major computational improvement__:  Support for new catalog types (e.g, diffuse maps), new analysis tools, changes to parallelization scheme
* __Small improvements__: Better documentation or example code, outer framework redesign.
