Description: # A CDK L3 Construct for a Secure Bucket
        
        This is an AWS CDK L3 Construct used to demonstrate the development and publishing process with the AWS CDK.
        
        Please refer to the blog post [here](https://www.matthewbonig.com/2020/01/11/creating-constructs) for more information.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Just import and use it.
        
        ```python
        # Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
        import aws_cdk.core as cdk
        from secure_bucket import SecureBucket
        
        class SandboxCdkStack(cdk.Stack):
            def __init__(self, scope, id, *, description=None, env=None, stackName=None, tags=None):
                super().__init__(scope, id, description=description, env=env, stackName=stackName, tags=tags)
        
                SecureBucket(self, "myBucket")
        ```
        
        ## Encryption options
        
        This is just a wrapper around an S3 Bucket and the [props](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3.BucketProps.html) are shared.
        
        However, you cannot supply an `UNENCRYPTED` option for the `encryption` property. If you do, or don't set it at all, it will use the `BucketEncryption.KMS_MANAGED` value by default.
        
        ## Integration Test
        
        If you want to see full usage, you can run
        
        ```shell script
        $ cdk synth
        ```
        
        to produce a basic stack with one SecureBucket resource
        
        ## L2 Construct - Inheritance vs Composition
        
        This construct is a wrapper around a standard L2 Bucket. However, because it wraps it, you can't just use it in all
        the same places you could use a standard L2 bucket. You have to pass around the public field `.bucket` from the construct.
        This was done as it's more representative of the types of constructs I expect people to build (composed of multiple L2s).
        However, if you were to actually want to use this construct in a production environment you'd
        probably use the inheritance model instead. Checkout the [feature/inheritance](https://github.com/mbonig/secure-bucket/tree/feature/inheritance) branch for that version.
