Description: # option-price
        `option-price` is a Python-based powerful but simple option price calculator. A GUI version is available [here](https://github.com/QSCTech-Sange/Options-Calculator). It makes use of vectorization, which makes it pretty fast.
        
        # Installation
        ```shell
        pip install option-price
        ```
        # Usage
        ```python
        from optionprice import Option
        ```
        
        An option can be initialized by:
        ```python
        some_option = Option(european=False,
                            kind=1,
                            s0=100,
                            k=120,
                            t=45,
                            sigma=0.01,
                            r=0.05,
                            dv=0)
        ```
        
        `option-price` has three approaches to calculate the price of the price of the option. They are
        + B-S-M
        + Monte Carlo
        + Binomial Tree
        
        `option-price` will choose B-S-M algorithm by default. Prices can be simply calculated by
        
        ```python
        some_option.getPrice()
        ```
        
        Other methods of calculation are available by adding some parameters. For instance,
        ```python
        some_option.getPrice(method='MC',iteration = 500000)
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```python
        some_option.getPrice(method='BT',iteration = 10000)
        ```
        
        while MC stands for Monte Carlo and BT stands for Binomial Tree. 
        
        The iteration has a default value 5000. Note that the larger the value, the slower and more precise the price.
