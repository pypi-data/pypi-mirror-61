# Seasonic/NZXT E-series PSUs

**Support for these devices is still experimental.**

## Initialization

It is necessary to initialize the device once it has been powered on.

```
# liquidctl initialize
```

_Note: at the moment initialize is a no-op, but this is likely to change once more features are added to the driver._



## Monitoring

The PSU is able to report monitoring data about its own hardware and the output rails.

```
