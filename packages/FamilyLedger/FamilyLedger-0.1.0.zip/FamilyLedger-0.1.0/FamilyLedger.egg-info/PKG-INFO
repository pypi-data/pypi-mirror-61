Description: Family Ledger
        =============
        
        **Family Ledger** is an application for collecting and viewing in-game item data
        held in World of Warcraft accounts.
        
        It has only been tested with vanilla World of Warcraft patch 1.12 at this time.
        
        There are actually two programs (scripts) for this application:
        
        * **ledger**: a pure command line program that outputs tabular data to file
          or to console. Available output file formats include Excel, CSV and TSV.
        * **ledger_web**: a program that starts a local web service so you can view 
          and refresh item data immediately in your web browser.
