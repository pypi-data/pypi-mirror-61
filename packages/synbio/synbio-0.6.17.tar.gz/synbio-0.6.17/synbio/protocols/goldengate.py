    Takes the design of a protocol and finds combinations of

    This Protocol is derived from NEB's guide:
    https://www.neb.com/protocols/2018/10/02/golden-gate-assembly-protocol-for-using-neb-golden-gate-assembly-mix-e1601

    Full responsibilities include

    * subselecting the input designs that will form valid plasmids after digestion with BsaI and BpiI
    * adding NEB Golden Gate Assembly Mix to the valid designs as Contents for a Container
    * computing the final plasmid (SeqRecord) after ligation of digested fragments
    * memoize the sorted enzyme + ids -> SeqRecord from step #3, pass as a
    * "mutate" method for the step after ThermoCycle()
    * add steps to carry out the rest of the assembly (heat shock, incubate, etc)
