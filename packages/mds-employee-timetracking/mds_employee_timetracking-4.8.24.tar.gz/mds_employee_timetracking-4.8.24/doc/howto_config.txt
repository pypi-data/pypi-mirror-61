The account rule determines the time account to which the working time is posted.

late work or night work is booked. Time account rules can be shared between 
multiple tariff models.

  check *Sat* and *Sun*

  account for your company

The break time rule causes a fixed time to be deducted as a break for a given 
daily working time. You can set several rules for different daily working hours. 
If you are not using break time control, leave the list blank.

Tab *Type of Presence*

At time entry, the *Type of Presence* selects the time account rule set.
