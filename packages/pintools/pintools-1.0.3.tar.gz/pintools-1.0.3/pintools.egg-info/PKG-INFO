        # Pintools
        Command line tools for working with [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in).
        
        Features:
        - Import starred repositories from Github
        - Copy saved reddit links
        - Organize tags based on originating site
        - Title fixer
        
        ## Install
        
        ```
        pip install pintools
        ```
        
        ### Dev install
        
        Requires [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/patrickleweryharris/pintools.git
        $ cd pintools
        $ make install
        ```
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Pinboard Authentication
        
        Pintools uses [lionheart/pinboard.py](https://github.com/lionheart/pinboard.py)
        to connect with Pinboard. Authentication is completed using your Pinboard API
        token, which can be found in [settings->password](https://pinboard.in/settings/password) on Pinboard.
        
        Pintools will by default look for your Pinboard API token in `$PINBOARD_API_TOKEN`. Alternatively it
        can be specified using the `--pinboard_token` argument if you do not want to use
        the environment variable.
        
        ### Sync Github Stars
        
        Pintools can be used to copy Github stars to your Pinboard account. Starred
        gists are not currently copied.
        
        Usage:
        ```
        pintools github [-h] [--token TOKEN]
        ```
        
        #### Github Authentication
        
        Pintools uses [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) to connect to
        Github. In order to authenticate with Github, you will need to create a [Personal
        Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in your Github account, with the
        `read:user` scope.
        
        Pintools will look for this Personal Access Token in `$PYGITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
        Alternatively, this token can be specified using the `--token` arguement
        
        ### Sync Reddit Saved Links
        Pintools can be used to copy Reddit saved items to your Pinboard account. Note
        that new saved items can be saved via [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com), but if you want to
        back up the entirety of your saved links, you need to use a script like this
        because IFTTT will only work on new saved items.
        
        Saved comments are not currently copied.
        
        Usage:
        ```
        pintools reddit [-h] [--secret SECRET] [--client_id CLIENT_ID] USERNAME PASSWORD
        ```
        
        #### Reddit Authentication
        
        Pintools uses [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to connect with
        Reddit. You will need to crate a developer application (personal use script) on
        Reddit in order to authenticate. Please follow the PRAW insructions on 'Password
        Flow'
        [here](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html#password-flow).
        
        Once you have created a personal use script application on Reddit, save the
        Client-ID and Client-Secret. By default, pintools will look for these in
        `$REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` and `$REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`. Alternatively, these can be
        specified using the `--client_id` and `--secret` arguments. Username and
        password for Reddit must also be provided on the command line.
        
        ### Organize Pinboard links by originating site
        
        Pintools can be used to tag each bookmark against the originating site,
        for easier organization. For example, any bookmark from `github.com` will
        be tagged with `github`.
        
        Usage:
        ```
        pintools tags [-h] [--config CONFIG_FILE]
        ```
        This can be optionally customized using a config file. The config file can group several
        domains under one URL.
        
        The config file uses YAML syntax like so:
        ```
        domains: # list title must always be 'domains'
          utoronto: # Each key is the final tag you want on your bookmarks
            - utoronto # each item in the list is the base URL you want the tag associated with
            - cs.toronto # don't include .com or www.
          twitter:
            - t
            - twitter
        ```
        There is an example config file [here](domain_assoc.yml)
        
        ### Fix Titles
        Pintools can fix bookmark titles for you, which sometimes get messed up when
        saving bookmarks automatically with IFTTT.
        
        Usage:
        ```
        pintools titles [-h] [--tag TAG]
        ```
        In order to prevent accidentally nuking all your bookmark titles, this feature
        operates on a single tag. For each bookmark with the tag specified, pintools
        will grab the title of the URL, and update the bookmark's title in Pinboard.
