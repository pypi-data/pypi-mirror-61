InVEST: Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs 
================================================================

Release: |release|

InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) is a family
of tools for quantifying the values of natural capital in clear, credible, and
practical ways. In promising a return (of societal benefits) on investments in
nature, the scientific community needs to deliver knowledge and tools to
quantify and forecast this return. InVEST enables decision-makers to quantify
the importance of natural capital, to assess the tradeoffs associated with
alternative choices, and to integrate conservation and human development.

Older versions of InVEST ran as script tools in the ArcGIS ArcToolBox environment,
but have almost all been ported over to a purely open-source python environment.

InVEST is licensed under a permissive, modified BSD license.
