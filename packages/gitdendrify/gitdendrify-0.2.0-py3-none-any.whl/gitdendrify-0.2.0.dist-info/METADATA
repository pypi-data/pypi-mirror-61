# Git dendrify

This package provides a tool to convert a git history between *linear*
and *structured* forms.  In linear form, development history is broken
down into sections and subsections by including HTML-like tag text in
the commit-message subjects.  In structured form, the sections and
subsections are represented using merge commits.

See [the project homepage](https://github.com/bennorth/git-dendrify)
for more information.
