This Python package is created to remove outlier rows from a dataset.
To use thi dataset you ned to create a pandas dataframe(you can use 
pd.read_csv() to do it), and to to use this package your dataset

then you can use one hot encoding or simple label encoder to do that,
but make sure before using it that it is all done.
