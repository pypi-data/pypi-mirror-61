Description: Poezio OMEMO plugin
        ###################
        
        This is a `Poezio <https://poez.io>`_ plugin providing OMEMO support. It
        distributed separately for licensing reasons.
        
        This plugin is very much **alpha**. It handles encryption and decryption
        of OMEMO messages, but doesn't display the encryption state of messages,
        and neither does it have a way to do trust management. As this plugin is
        still changing often, it is recommended that users follow experimental
        (master) versions of this project and its dependencies.
        
        License
        -------
        
        This plugin is licensed under GPLv3.
        
        Note on the underlying OMEMO library
        ------------------------------------
        
        As stated in `python-xeddsa's
        README <https://github.com/Syndace/python-xeddsa/blob/136b9f12c8286b9463566308963e70f090b60e50/README.md>`_,
        (dependency of python-omemo), this library has not undergone any
        security audits. If you have the knowledge, any help is welcome.
        
        Please take this into consideration when using this library.
        
        Installation
