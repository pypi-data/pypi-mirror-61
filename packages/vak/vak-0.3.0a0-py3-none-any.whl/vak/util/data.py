    saved_data_dict_paths : dict
        with keys {'train', 'test', 'val'} and values being the path

    Saves three 'data_dict' files (train, validation, and test)
    in output_dir, with following structure:
        spects : list
            of ndarray, spectrograms from audio files
        filenames : list
            same length as spects, filename of each audio file that was converted to spectrogram
        freq_bins : ndarray
            vector of frequencies where each value is a bin center. Same for all spectrograms
        time_bins : list
            of ndarrays, each a vector of times where each value is a bin center.
            One for each spectrogram
        labelset : list
            of strings, labels corresponding to each spectrogram
        labeled_timebins : list
            of ndarrays, each same length as time_bins but value is a label for that bin.
            In other words, the labels vector is mapped onto the time_bins vector for the
            spectrogram.
        X : ndarray
            X_train, X_val, or X_test, depending on which data_dict you are looking at.
            Some number of spectrograms concatenated, enough so that the total duration
            of the spectrogram in time bins is equal to or greater than the target duration.
            If greater than target, then X is truncated so it is equal to the target.
        Y : ndarray
            Concatenated labeled_timebins vectors corresponding to the spectrograms in X.
        spect_ID_vector : ndarray
            Vector where each element is an ID for a song. Used to randomly grab subsets
            of data of a target duration while still having the subset be composed of
            individual songs as much as possible. So this vector will look like:
            [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 1, ... , n, n, n] where n is equal to or (a little) less
            than the length of spects. spect_ID_vector.shape[-1] is the same as X.shape[-1]
            and Y.shape[0].
        timebin_dur : float
            duration of a timebin in seconds from spectrograms
        spect_params : dict
            parameters for computing spectrogram as specified in config.ini file.
            Will be checked against .ini file when running other cli such as learn_curve.py
        labels_mapping : dict

    all spectrograms => target_duration, and then truncates at target duration.
    Returns vector of indices to select randomly-drawn subset from total dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spect_ID_vector : ndarray
        vector where each element is an ID for a song. Used to randomly grab subsets
        of data of a target duration while still having the subset be composed of
        individual spectrograms as much as possible. So this vector will look like:
        [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 1, ... , n, n, n] where each n is the ID for one
        spectrogram, i.e. one audio file.
        spect_ID_vector.shape[-1] is the same as spectrograms.shape[-1] and labels.shape[0].
    labeled_timebins_vector : numpy.ndarray
        vector of same length as spect_ID_vector but each element is a label for the timebin,
        i.e. one of the possible classes.
    labels_mapping : dict
        maps string labels to consecutive integers. Used to check that the randomly drawn
        data set contains all classes.
    target_duration : float
        target duration of training set in seconds.
    timebin_dur_in_s : float
        duration of each timebin, i.e. each column in spectrogram, in seconds.
        Default is 0.001 s (1 ms)
    max_iter : int
        number of iterations to try drawing random subset of song that contains
        all classes in labels mapping.
        Default is 1000.
    method : str
        {'rand', 'incfreq'}
        method by which to obtain subset from training set.
        'incfreq' grabs songs at random but starts from the subset
        that includes the least frequently occurring class. Continues
        to grab randomly in order of increasing frequency until all
        classes are present, and then goes back to 'rand' method.
        'rand' grabs songs totally at random.
        Default is 'incfreq'.

    Returns
    -------
    inds_to_use : numpy.ndarray
        numpy array of indices, to index into rows of X_train that belong to chosen subset
        (assumes X_train is one long spectrogram, consisting of all
        training spectrograms concatenated, and each row being one timebin)
