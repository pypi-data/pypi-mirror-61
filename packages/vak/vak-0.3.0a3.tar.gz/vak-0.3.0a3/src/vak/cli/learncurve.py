    """generate learning curve, by training models on training sets across a
    range of sizes and then measure accuracy of those models on a test set

    Parameters
    ----------
    train_vds_path : str
        path to Dataset that represents training data
    test_vds_path : str
        path to Dataset that represents test data
    total_train_set_duration : int
        total duration of training set, in seconds
    train_set_durs : list
        of int, durations in seconds of subsets taken from training data
        to create a learning curve, e.g. [5, 10, 15, 20]
    num_replicates : int
        number of times to replicate training for each training set duration
        to better estimate mean accuracy for a training set of that size.
        Each replicate uses a different randomly drawn subset of the training
        data (but of the same duration).
    networks : dict
        where each key is the name of a neural network and the corresponding
        value is the configuration for that network (in a namedtuple or a dict)
    num_epochs : int
        number of training epochs. One epoch = one iteration through the entire
        training set.
    config_file : str
        path to config.ini file. Used to rewrite file with options determined by
        this function and needed for other functions (e.g. cli.summary)
    val_vds_path : str
        path to Dataset that represents validation data.
        Default is None, in which case accuracy is not measured on validation set
        during training.
    val_error_step : int
        step/epoch at which to estimate accuracy using validation set.
        Default is None, in which case accuracy is not measured on validation set
        during training.
    checkpoint_step : int
        step/epoch at which to save to checkpoint file.
        Default is None, in which case checkpoint is only saved at the last epoch.
    patience : int
        number of epochs to wait without the error dropping before stopping the
        training. Default is None, in which case training continues for num_epochs
    save_only_single_checkpoint_file : bool
        if True, save only one checkpoint file instead of separate files every time
        we save. Default is True.
    normalize_spectrograms : bool
        if True, use utils.spect.SpectScaler to normalize the spectrograms.
        Normalization is done by subtracting off the mean for each frequency bin
        of the training set and then dividing by the std for that frequency bin.
        This same normalization is then applied to validation + test data.
    use_train_subsets_from_previous_run : bool
        if True, use training subsets saved in a previous run
    previous_run_path : str
        path to results directory from a previous run
    root_results_dir : str
        path in which to create results directory for this run of cli.learncurve
    save_transformed_data : bool
        if True, save transformed data (i.e. scaled, reshaped). The data can then
        be used on a subsequent run of learncurve (e.g. if you want to compare results
        from different hyperparameters across the exact same training set).
        Also useful if you need to check what the data looks like when fed to networks.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Saves results in root_results_dir and adds some options to config_file.
