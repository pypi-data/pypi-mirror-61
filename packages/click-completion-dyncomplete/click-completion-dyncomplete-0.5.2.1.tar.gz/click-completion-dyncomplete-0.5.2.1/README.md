# click-completion
Enhanced completion for Click

Add automatic completion support for [fish], [Zsh], [Bash] and
[PowerShell] to [Click].

All the supported shells are able to complete all the command line
arguments and options defined with click. In addition, fish and Zsh are
also displaying the options and commands help during the completion.

## Activation

In order to activate the completion, you need to:

* initialize the `click_completion` module;
* inform your shell that completion is available for your script, and how.

### `click_completion` initialization

`click_completion` monkey-patches `click` in order to enhance the native
completion capabilities. This is done very simply:

    import click_completion
    click_completion.init()

Once done, your click application is ready for completion.

### Inform your shell

`click_completion` has some functions to produce the code to be executed
by the shell during the completion, and to permanently install this code
in a place that is automatically loaded by the shell.

The key functions are:

* `get_code`
* `install`

An example of usage can be found in [examples/click-completion-command](examples/click-completion-command)
and in [examples/click-completion-callback](examples/click-completion-callback)

## Dependencies

`click-completion` obviously depends on `click`. `Jinja2` is used to
 generate the shell specific code.

And of course to make it useful, you'll need to use fish, Bash, Zsh or
PowerShell.

## Customizing completion

### Application level

`click_complete` has a `startswith` function that can be replaced by a
custom one in order to customize the completion. Some extra environment
variable to be used during the completion can be passed to `get_code`
and `install`. An example is available in [examples/click-completion-command](examples/click-completion-command).

### Parameter type level

The custom parameter type may reimplement the `complete` method in order
to customize the completion result. The `complete` method takes the
current context and the incomplete argument to be completed. It can
return either a list of argument value that match the incomplete
argument, or a list of tuples `(arg, help)`. This last form is preferred
because it allows to display the help during the completion for the
shells that supports it.

An example can be found in the class `DocumentedChoice` in [click_completion/__init__.py](click_completion/__init__.py).


## How it works

As click, the general way `click_completion` works is through a magic environment
variable called `_<PROG_NAME>_COMPLETE`, where `<PROG_NAME>` is your application
executable name in uppercase with dashes replaced by underscores.

If your tool is called foo-bar, then the magic variable is called
`_FOO_BAR_COMPLETE`. By exporting it with the `source` value it will spit out the
activation script which can be trivially activated.

For instance, to enable fish completion for your foo-bar script, this is what
you would need to put into your `~/.config/fish/completions/foo-bar.fish`

    eval (env _FOO_BAR_COMPLETE=source-fish foo-bar)

From this point onwards, your script will have fish completion enabled.

The above activation example will always invoke your application on startup.
This might be slowing down the shell activation time significantly if you have
many applications. Alternatively, you could also ship a file with the contents
of that, which is what Git and other systems are doing.

This can be easily accomplished:

    _FOO_BAR_COMPLETE=source-fish foo-bar > ~/.config/fish/completions/foo-bar.fish
