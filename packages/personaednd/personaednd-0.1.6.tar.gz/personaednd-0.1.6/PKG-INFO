        ### 1. Introduction
        
        > "plural personae : a character in a fictional presentation (such as a novel or play) —usually used in plural" 
        
        > “Persona.” The Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Inc., https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/personae.
        
        ***personaednd*** is a tool for generating 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons characters for both Players and DMs.
        
        With no offense given towards those who prefer such, ***personaednd*** attempts to generate characters according to a "role player" perspective and not from a "roll player" perspective.
        
        ### 2. Installation
        
        Installation is pretty simple and straightforward.

        ###### Customization
        
        All the character data used within the application: backgrounds, classes, feats, skills, tools, races and weapon proficiencies, are defined within a YAML file within the *sources* sub package called *sources.yml*. This file can be modified to include additional content by following the defined format.
        
        ### 4. Change Log
        
        ###### Version *0.1.6 (2.16.20)*
        
        - Added Duergar and Sea Elf subraces from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes to sources file. Updated Eladrin to reflect the version described in the aforementioned book.
          - TODO: Eventually plan to add all subraces from MBoF.
        
        ###### Version *0.1.5 (2.8.20)*
        
        - Added -variant option to CLI interface. Accepts 'false' or 'true'. Defaults at 'false'.
        - Added variant argument to ScoreImprovement constructor.
        - Fixed Skills.select_skills overlap bug.
        - Added variant argument to Skills.select_skills method.
        - Proficiency bonus now uses formula to determine the value (level/4) + 1.
        
        ###### Version *0.1.4 (2.2.20)*
        
        - Fixed a typo in the setup script at release.
        
        ###### Version *0.1.3 (2.2.20)*
        
        - Merged version updates 0.1.2 with 0.1.3.
        - Overall better ability score assignments.
        - Redone the ScoreAssigner and ScoreImprovement classes. They both implement the quick build rules for each class by default.
        - Added --version option to CLI interface.
        - Code rewrite for the purpose of better adhering to PEP-8 coding standards.
        - VERSION REBOOT - Restarted version numbering since the transformation of personaednd from a GUI to a CLI application.
        
        ###### Version *0.1.1 (1.12.20)*
        
        - Various code tweaks and fixes.
        
        ###### Version *0.1.0 (1.4.20)*
        
        - Fixed tool proficiency selection for Monks.
        - Skilled feat now works to give a choice of three bonus skills and/or TOOLS. Previously only selected three skills.
        - Renamed sub package 'app_data' to 'source'.
        
        ###### Version *0.0.9 (12.27.19)*
        
        - Weapon Master feat now adds proficiency with four simple or martial weapons as normal.
        - Fixed functionality with Lightly Armored, Moderately Armored, Heavily Armored, and Weapon Master feats in the has_requirements Feats class method.
            - If the character has Light armor proficiency they won't meet the requirements for Lightly Armored.
            - If the character has Medium armor proficiency they won't meet the requirements for Moderately Armored.
            - If the character has Heavy armor proficiency they won't meet the requirements for Heavily Armored.
            - If a character is proficient with Martial weapons, they likely have proficiency with Simple weapons too, meaning they can already use all weapons and thus won't "meet" the requirements for Weapon Master.
        - Added work around for numpy bug in dice roller array.
        
        ###### Version *0.0.8 (12.22.19)*

        - Re-coded various sections of the program.
        - Removed recipients or more accurate a 'suggestions' section from the _character.yaml file. The recipients section was originally used as a set of suggested classes that might chose a particular feat - most were left blank to begin with beforehand.
        - Added background equipment list to character sheet.
        - Added debugging output to 'Dice.roll_drop_lowest' method.
        
        ###### Version *0.0.5 (12.13.19)*
        
        - Code tweaks.

        - Modified 'Dice.roll_drop_lowest' to generate all six ability scores instead of one.
        - Removed 'roll_ability_scores' function. Functionality transferred to 'Dice.roll_drop_lowest'.

        - Character 'background' has been added to the character sheet.
