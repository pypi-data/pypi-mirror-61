"""
If you're choosing to present your application via the browser, chances are
excellent that you'll want to handle POST-forms. It's possible atop the basic
implementation, but this module should make your life easier in this regard.

The concept of operations is that you subclass Formlet and fill in a few
blanks to get fully-working form pages. In practice you'll probably make a
general subclass that talks to your main presentation templates, and then
specific subclasses for each sort of record you want to edit or create.

The base Formlet constructor requires a dictionary of FormElement objects
which give personality to each of the (notional) fields for whatever sort of
record your formlet is editing. The FormElement doesn't store the field name,
so you can reuse the same one for different fields that have basically the
same behavior.

A small note: Dealing gracefully with incomplete or incorrect user-input
is always more challenging than the happy path.
