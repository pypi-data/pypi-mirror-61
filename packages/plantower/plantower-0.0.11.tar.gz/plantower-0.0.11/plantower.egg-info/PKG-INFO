Description: # Plantower Particulate Sensor Python interface
        A basic python interface for interacting with the plantower PM sensors.  This code has been tested with the following devices:
         * Plantower PMS5003
         * Plantower PMS7003
         * Plantower PMSA003
         
         It may work with other sensors from the plantower range, if you try it please do let us know either way.  If there are any problems with it please either raise an issue or fix it and issue a pull request.
