Description: # Outlier Removal Using InterQuartile Range

         ## InterQuartile Range (IQR) Description Any set of data can be described by its five-number summary. 
         These five numbers, which give you the information you need to find patterns and outliers, consist of: The minimum value of the dataset. 
         <br> The first quartile Q1, which represents a quarter(25%) of the way through the list of all data. <br> The median of the data set, which represents the midpoint(50%) of the whole list of data. <br> The third quartile Q3, which represents three-quarters(75%) of the way through the list of all data. <br> The maximum value of the data set. <br> <br> These five values helps in determining exceptional(outliers) elements present in our dataset. ## Calculation of IQR IQR = Q3 â€“ Q1 <br> MIN = Q1 - (1.5*IQR) <br> MAX = Q3 + (1.5*IQR) <br> ## Installation Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install outlierRemoval-kvarshney-101703295. ```bash pip install outlierRemoval-kvarshney-101703295 ``` <br> ## How to use this package: outlierRemoval-kvarshney-101703295 can be run as shown below: ### In Command Prompt ``` >> outlierRemoval dataset.csv ``` <br> ## Sample dataset Marks | Students :------------: | :-------------: 3  | Student 1 57 | Student 2 65 | Student 3 98 | Student 4 43 | Student 5 44 | Student 6 54 | Student 7 1  | Student 8 <br> ## Output Dataset after Removal Marks | Students :------------: | :-------------: 57 | Student2 65 | Student3 98 | Student4 43 | Student5 44 | Student6 54 | Student7 <br> It is clearly visible that the rows containing Student1 and Student8 have been removed due to them being Outliers. ## License [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
