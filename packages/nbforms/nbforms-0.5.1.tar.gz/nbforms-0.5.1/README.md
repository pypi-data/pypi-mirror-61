nbforms is a Python package designed to allow forms to be submitted by users such that the data they submit is immediately available for use in the notebook by the entire group. This is accomplished using ipywidgets and a Heroku-deployable Sinatra webapp, [nbforms-server](https://github.com/chrispyles/nbforms-server).

## Installation

To install the Python package, use pip:

```
pip install nbforms
```
