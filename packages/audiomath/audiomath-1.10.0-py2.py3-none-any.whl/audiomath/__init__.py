"""
`audiomath` is a package for reading, manipulating, and writing
sound waveforms. It also lets you record and play sounds, with a
high degree of real-time control over playback.

To manipulate sound waveforms, plot them, and write them to disk,
use the `Sound` class.  Usually you would initialize a `Sound`
instance from a filename, or from a `numpy` array---in the latter
case your array would contain floating-point values in the range
[-1, +1], arranged samples-by-channels.

To play sounds, use the `Player` class.  You can initialize a
`Player` instance from a `Sound` instance, or from anything that
can be used to create one (e.g. a filename).  You can also supply
a sequence of `Sound` instances, or a sequence of filenames or a
`glob` pattern that matches multiple files: then you can have the
`Player` instance manage multiple "tracks".  Each `Player` will
only play one sound at a time: to overlap sounds, create multiple
`Player` instances.

To record a sound, use the `Record` function,  or the `Recorder`
class if you want to do it asynchronously.
