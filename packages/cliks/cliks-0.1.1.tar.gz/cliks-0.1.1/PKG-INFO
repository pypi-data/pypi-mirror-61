Description: # cliks
        
        CLI for facilitate and standardize commit message.
        
        
        # Format:
          
        __ACTION(TOPIC): COMMIT_MSG #TICKET_NUM [!TAG ...]__
        
        
        ## ACTION:
        
        - `feat`: is for new features, big improvement
        - `fix`: is for bug fixes
        - `refactor`: is for code refactoring, without any visual user change
        - `chore`: is for any else but the app
        - `test`: is for any kind of tests (functionnal, unitary...)
        - `style`: is for cosmetic changes (spaces vs tab...)
        - `docs`: is for documentation
        
        
        ## TOPIC 
        
        is optional and to specify the part on the app you're working on is WHO is concerned by the change.
        
        - `dev`:  is for developpers (API changes, refactors...)
        - `usr`:  is for final users (UI changes)
        - `pkg`:  is for packagers   (packaging changes)
        - `test`: is for testers     (test only related changes)
        
        
        ## COMMIT_MSG 
        
        is ... well ... the commit message itself.
        
        
        ## #TICKET_NUM 
        
        is the ticket number associated. If you don't want to specify a ticket number, use:
        - `#noticket`; or
        - `#nt`
        
        
        # TAGs 
        
        Are additionnal adjective as 'refactor' 'minor' 'cosmetic'. They are preceded with a '!' or a '@' (prefer the former, as the latter is wrongly interpreted in github.) Commonly used tags are:
        
        - `refactor`: is obviously for refactoring code only
        - `minor`: is for a very meaningless change (a typo, adding a comment)
        - `cosmetic`: is for cosmetic driven change (re-indentation, 80-col...)
        - `wip`: is for partial functionality but complete subfunctionality.
        
        
        # Example:
        
        - `git commit -m "feat(ansible):` adding configuration with common roles #INF-4"
        - `git commit -m "fix(docker):` disabling systemd and installing sysvinit #noticket"
        - `git commit -m "docs():` removing unwanted files on the doc #noticket"
        - `git commit -m` 'Please note that multi-line commit message are supported, and only the first line will be considered as the "summary" of the commit message. So tags, and other rules only applies to the summary.  The body of the commit message will be displayed in the changelog without reformatting.'
